They are unethical, narcissistic dickwads who are too stupid to ever understand how lying about something to further a personal cause is terrible. Defense mechanism. Much easier to think that than to realize you're wrong about guns and this shit is real. 1. Some people suffer mental disorders, and struggle to discern reality from falsehoods;
2. Some people are of very low intelligence, and struggle to discern reality from falsehoods;
3. Some people are brainwashed by religion, and struggle to discern reality from falsehoods;
4. Some people are brainwashed by their political affiliation, and struggle to discern reality from falsehoods; and
5. Some people are cunts. It's everything to do with confirmation bias and nothing to do with reality. If educating yourself, developing critical thinking skills and examining your conscience feels like too much work, ""Confirmation Bias"" becomes your magic wand. 

Confirmation bias remakes Reality in your image. The World is a complicated world.
It has been simpler, but the Internet makes things even more complex (a lot of information) and that makes it for some people complicated.
Complicated as in, ""I don't understand the world anymore."" Or ""it's too much, I can handle it anymore"". 

As a remedy, or easy response, you start denying reality and shape your own bubble.
Back in the days, when the world was simpler, pre-internet, you accepted things as they were.

Now you don't, and you find others that don't. And the Internet makes and facilitates this.
You will find someone that doesn't want the reality that is given (read : facts), so you're not alone and you build your bubble.

And that feels great, together with like minded people, denying either the holocaust, claiming that the earth is flat and that Sandy Hook never took place.

Oh, ja, lest not forget, that the grieve of those parents is staged. Because they don’t want to accept it.

Someone whispered in their ears exactly what they want to hear and instead of verifying it, they took it and ran with it. Tribalism is one hell of a drug. Additionally to the replies given already, we can never, ever forget that many, many people are just plain *stupid and gullible*. A rational mind alters its beliefs to suit the facts.  An irrational mind tries to alter the facts to suit its beliefs.

(I'm paraphrasing a quote but couldn't find the source, I'm sure the original was said better.)

These people are so dedicated to their gun culture that they refuse to believe anything that challenges it.  Guns are good, they only save lives, therefore anyone claiming to kill a bunch of kids must be a liar. because its always the republican party responible for it.  So they act like its fake, like racism. I don't really think it's that many people, but it's a combination of:

1. Extreme 2nd Amendment types who think that mass shootings are a government / George Soros plot to seize all firearms (and let's be honest, gun control advocates often do exploit these events).

2. Conspiracy types that tend to attribute most major events to various secret conspiracies. Because otherwise they'd have to realize that their politics are getting kids killed, and they'd have to feel bad about it. instead, they double down on the crazy in an attempt to avoid culpability Democracy must be taught. By professional educators. Not the lowest bidder. Mental illness, a need to feel in control of their world, politically motivated denial, fetal alcohol syndrome....

To name a few. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) **trump and his supporters Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopath)** 

Symptoms Antisocial personality disorder (Mayo Clinic) signs and symptoms may include: 

- Disregard for right and wrong
- Persistent lying or deceit to exploit others
- Being callous, cynical and disrespectful of others
- Using charm or wit to manipulate others for personal gain or personal pleasure
- Arrogance, a sense of superiority and being extremely opinionated
- Recurring problems with the law, including criminal behavior
- Repeatedly violating the rights of others through intimidation and dishonesty
- Impulsiveness or failure to plan ahead
- Hostility, significant irritability, agitation, aggression or violence
- Lack of empathy for others and lack of remorse about harming others
- Unnecessary risk-taking or dangerous behavior with no regard for the safety of self or others
- Poor or abusive relationships
- Failure to consider the negative consequences of behavior or learn from them
- Being consistently irresponsible and repeatedly failing to fulfill work or financial obligations People believe what they want to believe and ignore the rest. Why we have conspiracy theory explosion. No critical thinkers. There was a video called 'Where the hell is Matt', which featured a guy doing a silly dance in cities all over the world.

He got accused of using robots instead of people because 'nobody could go to all those different places'.

That it would be much more difficult and expensive to create lifelike dancing robots did not persuade the wackaloons they were wrong.

The robots in action:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY A lot of people grow up being told one thingm and told to ignore anything that challenges that. I knew of a kid who got upset in geometry class about what happens when a ball guys a surface at an angle. He refused to accept anything except that balls bounce off surfaces at 90 degrees, every time, no matter what. 


Got the kid a ball from gym. Let him test this. He swore it was a trick by us and refused to accept the results of his tests. 


He took information that read against his knowledge personally. It was a personal attack to him and he refused to accept reality. It's the same thing with these people, information isn't data to exchange and figure it out, it's a personal thing that must be defended, right or wrong, believe it. 


It's why when you see liberals talk, they discuss and exchange information and peer review, test and move on with the best answer. When they get conflicting information, they're confused and look over the information.

 Conservitives it's about their way is right and that's that. They'll get angry and demand their way is the best way, then purify and kick out anyone that's different. There are bullying thugs in every level of human society and they set themselves up as the standard bearers for what is acceptable thought and what is not. These thoughts are almost never based on fact. 

These thugs will harass and heckle anyone who disagrees with them. They will ostracize people who disagree with them.  They will organize the community to shun the people who disagree with them and in more lawless societies, they will kill the people who disagree with them.  In Reddit, they brigade. 

And we have a subset of people who were harassed and bullied from a young age and they will go along with the stupidity of Uncle Tony on Facebook because they don't have the backbone to disagree. The only other option is to acknowledge that your resisting any firearm regulations has been a cause of massive amounts of innocent deaths.  Counter that with people who have been conditioned for years to base belief on what is desired rather than what is evident, and it's clear which reality will cause less cognitive dissonance. 50% of the country is of below average intelligence.  Let me state that percentage again....*50* Many reasons but I don’t think we can discount the fact that our government and the CIA have engaged in ACTUAL disinformation campaigns. This has caused widespread distrust of the “official” story. People don’t know what the boundary is between truth and misinformation. For the same reason politicians know about them within seconds.

45,Former Conservative making the switch finally.,Liberal,SilentAlpha,t5_2qxt5,dhraef,"Well to be fair the right is anything but ""conservative"" these days. There was just nothing of value left for you on that side anymore. 
By the way, that doesn't mean that you have to join "" the other side"". If you are truly a conservative, nothing is forcing you to abandon your ideals. You can be a conservative that just doesn't support Trump or any current republicans. Even if that means voting WITH the left. I don't hate republicans, as a matter of fact - I had a lot of respect for republicans. But most of them won't admit that they are republicans. That's too bad, because republicans really had something to offer.

You may notice I use the word republican - not Crazy-Trump supporter, not conservatives (they aren’t) not tea party, libertarians, etc. I mean REAL republicans, the ones who used to have really good ideas, cared about how government works, cared that everybody gets a fair shake, were willing to compromise for the good of everyone, and feel impassioned about what happened to the environment, and SUPPORT efforts to fix Human-Caused Climate Change, and they weren’t racists, liars, or trump-bullies.

Where are those republicans? And why are they silent? I’d be described as “right of center” by most liberals, (and most conservatives would describe me as a raging liberal, because the middle seems so far away when youre all the way to the right) but ive been boycotting the GOP for nearly a decade now. And the GOP that I started boycotting seems so tame compared to the GOP that Im currently boycotting. Maybe there will come a day when they deserve our vote again, but that day seems far away. Glad you took a step back and noticed the GOP’s problems. The only way they’ll ever be a viable party again is if their reliable voters start to punish them for their BS. Thank you for joining the fight. With luck, we’ll have a viable conservative party again one day. Welcome!

Jesus would be proud, I think. For the devil wears many disguises and right now I would say the liars on the Republican side are his legion. And hello you, Sir.

May I ask whether there was a specific recent event that made you ""make the switch""? Nice. I think you will find Democrats to be much more compatible with the new testament anyway. Welcome. I've admired the kindness of so many faith based organizations to the poor and destitute. I am not in your faith group but I assure you that when it comes to human decency we have more in common than not. The welcome here is genuine. Amen! What was the tipping point? I wish more people who call themselves Republican/conservative would embrace the same level of introspection you did. I have a feeling many of them would come to the same conclusion. In any event, Welcome I grew up in the Reagan/Bush1 era and was extremely arch-conservative due to Southern Baptist upbringing and the charm of the Gipper.  I rooted for Alex P. Keaton on *Family Ties*.  

When I got into my 30's, it took a monumental goatfuck like the Iraq invasion to jolt me into realizing everything with the Republicans isn't on the up-and-up.  That opened up a whole world of questioning authority and things I was told and taught as a child.  I certainly don't endorse everything the Democrats do as a party and there is plenty of hypocrisy on both sides, but in general, every day I wake up, I'm more liberal than the day before.  I'm like the opposite of the Winston Churchill quote. Uhm... But you know liberalism isn't left, right? Welcome! Regardless of where you come from, what you worship, or otherwise, I think you'll find this general side of the aisle to be a little more compassionate and caring towards our fellow Americans and our fellow human beings in general, and a little less concerned with the almighty dollar and what the obscenely wealthy have to say about it. Hello! I attend an evangelical church in Alabama.  I made the switch sometime around the Obama/Romney election.  I hadn't noticed the crazy before that (I voted McCain), but during that contest it was made quite evident that the GOP had some problems.  Mostly with the racism, but also the conspiracy theories, and (what I term) ""absolutism"" - their inability to accept compromise.

I wouldn't deem myself a 'liberal"" though.  I am a middle of the road independent, but one who believes the government CAN be used to do good for the people and not just select groups (schools, roads, health care, etc...).  These day's however, you are either an alt-right racist or a liberal, a false dichotomy set up by Fox News.  So there you go... Hello and welcome! Welcome. Honestly, as long as your conservative beliefs don’t need to be forced on other people, ie let gay people do what they want in private, etc, I’ve found the only real difference is tax policy (I don’t agree with either side, but lean more left on where to spend my tax dollars), some regulations and, possibly, abortion. Welcome! Fellow Christian former Republican from the south here! You’re not alone. Hi Welcome friend! Welcome! Thank you! Bring your family along! Stay Evangelical. Convince me. I'm open to argument. There is more opportunity to present your understanding of the truth on this side of the aisle. 

I'm pretty sure converting an atheist counts double and we have waaay more atheists. Your self-honesty is rare. Be proud. Welcome to the family. At this point it's not about party. We need to start just doing the right thing to and for each other. What's your stance on immigration? I'm not religious or socially conservative, and never was, so I don't have any experience with that, but what Comey said in his hearing rings true for me. The GOP left me, not the other way around. US liberals aren't left-wing. They're pretty-much just as right-wing as US conservatives. They're just socially progressive. Hello, and welcome. I am not an evangelical, myself, but I can tell you that there are a number of Christian faith groups that are moving left due to any and all social justice platforms being so viciously rejected by the right. I don't think ANYBODY is an ""every single issue"" type righty or lefty. evangelical will be next, you are waking up to realty and not the reality of the conservatives, AKA as fox entertainment.  I don't get the religious thing, but at least you are half way to normal.  good luck, may you find truth and be able to live your life, not be a slave to a religion/cult. well hello! glad to have you here welcome! I feel like both liberals and conservatives are extreme. There is no compromise and no middle ground between the two political parties. For me half my ideology is liberal and half is conservative. Welcome, no reason to check your evangelical background at the door.  I think you'll find Jesus's teachings on caring for the poor and loving your fellow man to be much more congruent with the politics of the left. I’m honestly in the opposite boat. I was liberal for a long time, but I’m getting disillusioned by the fact that the party has been shoving terrible deals down our throats (TPP, foreign replacement at both high level jobs (H1Bs being used to undercut American workers in tech) and low level (undocumented workers) jobs)

The longer I’ve been here, the more I see a mirror of what the Right was. Screaming morals and free stuff at the top of their lungs as a smokescreen to pass awful stuff behind our backs, all the while deriding the morals of the Lord and trying to replace them with man made ones.

I recommend becoming independent and letting the Lord do the decision making from there. The party idol that seems to command people around here is as deleterious as the one that floats around the Right. [deleted] Hey welcome!!!

I respect and admire you.  <3 Now, I know it’s not a mental illness, however I remember this being a big section in college about how it’s actually found to be like a wiring in the brain, just miss configured. Which proves the whole you are born that way thing, but couldn’t that kind of be considered a mental illness? Not in a negative way, but like how some people’s tastebuds thinks Cilantro tastes like soap. I find the concept of gender transitioning revolting and it makes me very upset simply thinking about it. SO FUCKING WHAT? That doesn't matter AT ALL. Just because something makes me uncomfortable doesnt mean I should force others to abide by what I want. People have the right to make decisions for themselves, and no matter how strange or even upsetting that decision is to me, I respect that decision and dont percieve them as less than or broken. They're still a person, no different than before, except now they're more comfortable with themself.

 I don't understand why some people want to force others to conform to their standards of normal at the cost of personal freedom when what that individual does affects only themself. People should really just try to talk to each other about why they feel certain ways rather than berate others for feeling a different way. At least then people could perhaps respect alternative perspectives to their own. I'm a liberal and this is my first time here! I'd like to talk about this tho because it's probably one of the few things I disagree with. I think that gender roles do alot of damage to our society and while I don't think that being trans is a mental disorder I think that it is a self induced form of depression brought on by not feeling as though they can full fill the gender roles they are supposed to fill. I respect gays, and trans because I think they serve us well in keeping people free spirited, but the idea of gender fluidity is counter productive in the fight again gender rolls. The mind is a spectrum but the body is not, but the body should not make us feel as though we need to change our minds. I would totally love to have a discussion about this, feel free to counter point!

100,"Who actually started the ""America is a Christian nation"" bullshit?",Liberal,Kayla9393,t5_2qxt5,dflxs1,"Cold war, I think. 

""In God we trust"" put on the money in 1956. 

Representative Charles Edward Bennett of Florida cited the Cold War when he introduced the bill in the House, saying ""In these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom, we should continually look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom"".  In Evangelical Christian circles, it’s been a mantra for decades. 

I think it really caught fire in public movements with the rise of the Moral Majority/Christian Coalition in the late ‘70s. It really started in the 1980's with Reagan.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority My friends (conservatives included) and I were just having a conversation about this. Currently, there is this pull for democratic countries to become more theocratic. The examples we were talking about were America, India, and Turkey. All these countries have secular constitutions and had fairly secular cultures. Over the years, however, they have become more right-wing and more religious. I think this has to do mostly with confusing religion and culture as the same thing. This tends to happen when people are insecure and are looking for something to hold on to.  

Personally, I think that theocratic pull in America is coming from evangelical Christian culture. If you listen to some of the evangelical preachers you can hear the silent dog-whistling that Christianity is under attack by the secular world. Or how we need to take back the country for god (who else?). Pastors spend most of their time validating Christianity rather than preaching about how to be a good Christian. They are good at making people feel like something is out to get them and they belong to a community that can protect them. What's more, that community has a mandate from God himself.

Politicians are just cashing in on this trend. They are using their respective majority religions of their country as a crutch to win elections and consolidate power. Its eirie af. It reminds me of Pope Urban II and the crusades. Dude, I don’t even know if this is relevant to this post, but I literally just one moment ago saw someone on Facebook comment that “one US soldier’s life is worth more than the entire country of Syria, and we should let them and the Turks kill themselves off”. I clicked on his profile to see what kind of human says such a thing... he’s a fucking PASTOR. His entire timeline is full of posts about Jesus and preaching sermons. 

I’m so fucking disgusted and just done with the hypocrisy of the Right. I think it’s time to delete Facebook entirely instead of just deactivating. America has always been a religious battleground between Protestants and Catholics. I was raised Catholic in the 50s and 60s. We were carefully taught who was and wasn't part of the True Religion. I remember contributing for pagan babies.
Catholics held the media hostage through approval of broadcast and movie codes. Protestants held public office. Part of the objection to immigrants from the South is their Catholic religion, imposed by Spain. The last bastion of Catholic power over government. Like the Irish and Italian, they threaten Protestant hegemony with their primitive Catholic ways. 
The founders knew the consequences of religion in government. Their people had fled the endless religious wars in Europe. The Spanish Inquisition and Calvinist witch prickers still roamed the land and nightmares. Christians Well, the latter half of Republican presidents put the nail in that coffin. Good ol religious family and perfect wife have been a literal platform since the 20s. The Second Great Awakening was definetly a watershed type movement in American History. Evangelicals have been chanting this bullshit along with fake professors and ""historians"" pushing their alternate version of the last 250 years.  Pure revisionist history. We must be a Christian nation, because who else but Christians could build a country using the blood of native people and the backs of slaves? Some of the founders were Christian but it really grew in the 19th century.  I suspect a big part of it was many Christians were anti-slavery. Unfortunately, once slavery ended they had little interest in the condition of the newly freed slaves. 

This is similar to anti-abortion views of a large part of the modern pro-life movement. Banning abortion is all that matters. Religious right about late 60s *“The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.”*  George Washington or John Adams I mean, you do realize that our original founders were mostly Christians. Is one nation under God ringing a bell. I mean, it's not as if we have any real state religion, but our history has dealt quite a deal with Christianity. >I never once heard anyone (not even Republican conservative people that I know) say that until around 4 or 5 years ago.

I've been hearing it since Reagan.

However, ""In God We Trust"" wasn't added to money and ""One Nation Under God"" wasn't added to the Pledge of Allegiance until the 1950s

So, I'm going with cold war Republicans. Oh, it's been around at least since Jerry Falwell in the late 70s/early 80s.  He was aided and abetted by revisionist historians like Peter Marshall and David Barton.  
But probably the first one to come right out and say it was a Supreme Court Justice named David Brewer, who in the case of Holy Trinity v. United States, stated the following: ""These, (referring to the cultural influence of Christianity in the US) and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation.""  This was in 1892.  In 1905, he clarified that to say that it was a Christian nation in the sense of the privileging of Christianity in the overall public life in the USA.    
The Holy Trinity case was about the constitutionality of an Episcopal congregation calling as their pastor a priest from England.  Back then it was a violation of an 1885 law prohibiting companies to hire laborers from overseas.

Trying to change history only makes you look like an idiot, no matter your motivation. Because there seems to be no shortage of people who poorly represent Jesus teaching, the term Christian and therefore Christian Nation s is m derogatory. I do not believe those who originally uttered it to mean that the nation should not appreciate its non Christian citizens. It think it was to emphasize that the nation was founded by many who believed in God and appreciated his teaching. Those principles were then used by them to establish the way religion should influence society AS OPPOSED to the way the King of England used the Church of England, its beliefs, and its relationship to government. 

I am a Christian and I do believe our constitution is consistent with my belief. That is not to say that it is to mean that one must have the same faith I do to deserve it. Neither do I think the original utterance of that phrase was intended to say that. The Christian's that built the nation [deleted]","Who actually started the ""America is a Christian nation"" bullshit?Cold war, I think. 

""In God we trust"" put on the money in 1956. 

Representative Charles Edward Bennett of Florida cited the Cold War when he introduced the bill in the House, saying ""In these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom, we should continually look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom"".  In Evangelical Christian circles, it’s been a mantra for decades. 

I think it really caught fire in public movements with the rise of the Moral Majority/Christian Coalition in the late ‘70s. It really started in the 1980's with Reagan.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority My friends (conservatives included) and I were just having a conversation about this. Currently, there is this pull for democratic countries to become more theocratic. The examples we were talking about were America, India, and Turkey. All these countries have secular constitutions and had fairly secular cultures. Over the years, however, they have become more right-wing and more religious. I think this has to do mostly with confusing religion and culture as the same thing. This tends to happen when people are insecure and are looking for something to hold on to.  

Personally, I think that theocratic pull in America is coming from evangelical Christian culture. If you listen to some of the evangelical preachers you can hear the silent dog-whistling that Christianity is under attack by the secular world. Or how we need to take back the country for god (who else?). Pastors spend most of their time validating Christianity rather than preaching about how to be a good Christian. They are good at making people feel like something is out to get them and they belong to a community that can protect them. What's more, that community has a mandate from God himself.

Politicians are just cashing in on this trend. They are using their respective majority religions of their country as a crutch to win elections and consolidate power. Its eirie af. It reminds me of Pope Urban II and the crusades. Dude, I don’t even know if this is relevant to this post, but I literally just one moment ago saw someone on Facebook comment that “one US soldier’s life is worth more than the entire country of Syria, and we should let them and the Turks kill themselves off”. I clicked on his profile to see what kind of human says such a thing... he’s a fucking PASTOR. His entire timeline is full of posts about Jesus and preaching sermons. 

I’m so fucking disgusted and just done with the hypocrisy of the Right. I think it’s time to delete Facebook entirely instead of just deactivating. America has always been a religious battleground between Protestants and Catholics. I was raised Catholic in the 50s and 60s. We were carefully taught who was and wasn't part of the True Religion. I remember contributing for pagan babies.
Catholics held the media hostage through approval of broadcast and movie codes. Protestants held public office. Part of the objection to immigrants from the South is their Catholic religion, imposed by Spain. The last bastion of Catholic power over government. Like the Irish and Italian, they threaten Protestant hegemony with their primitive Catholic ways. 
The founders knew the consequences of religion in government. Their people had fled the endless religious wars in Europe. The Spanish Inquisition and Calvinist witch prickers still roamed the land and nightmares. Christians Well, the latter half of Republican presidents put the nail in that coffin. Good ol religious family and perfect wife have been a literal platform since the 20s. The Second Great Awakening was definetly a watershed type movement in American History. Evangelicals have been chanting this bullshit along with fake professors and ""historians"" pushing their alternate version of the last 250 years.  Pure revisionist history. We must be a Christian nation, because who else but Christians could build a country using the blood of native people and the backs of slaves? Some of the founders were Christian but it really grew in the 19th century.  I suspect a big part of it was many Christians were anti-slavery. Unfortunately, once slavery ended they had little interest in the condition of the newly freed slaves. 

This is similar to anti-abortion views of a large part of the modern pro-life movement. Banning abortion is all that matters. Religious right about late 60s *“The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.”*  George Washington or John Adams I mean, you do realize that our original founders were mostly Christians. Is one nation under God ringing a bell. I mean, it's not as if we have any real state religion, but our history has dealt quite a deal with Christianity. >I never once heard anyone (not even Republican conservative people that I know) say that until around 4 or 5 years ago.

I've been hearing it since Reagan.

However, ""In God We Trust"" wasn't added to money and ""One Nation Under God"" wasn't added to the Pledge of Allegiance until the 1950s

So, I'm going with cold war Republicans. Oh, it's been around at least since Jerry Falwell in the late 70s/early 80s.  He was aided and abetted by revisionist historians like Peter Marshall and David Barton.  
But probably the first one to come right out and say it was a Supreme Court Justice named David Brewer, who in the case of Holy Trinity v. United States, stated the following: ""These, (referring to the cultural influence of Christianity in the US) and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation.""  This was in 1892.  In 1905, he clarified that to say that it was a Christian nation in the sense of the privileging of Christianity in the overall public life in the USA.    
The Holy Trinity case was about the constitutionality of an Episcopal congregation calling as their pastor a priest from England.  Back then it was a violation of an 1885 law prohibiting companies to hire laborers from overseas. The court ruled that while the letter of the law might prohibit this, the spirit of the law did not extend to clergy.  Not surprisingly, today's conservative judges have criticized this ruling, Antonin Scalia in particular stating that it leads to ""judicial lawmaking"".

A federal appeals court has granted President Trump a temporary stay of decision, and he will not have to turn over his tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney. Trumps attorneys are admitting there's a crime, and the tax forms are proof. Probably of tax evasion. But the thing is, they aren't charging him with any crime, they just want to see his tax returns.

The 2016 elections were a coup via decades of gerrymandering and aided by Russia. If we dig deep enough, we will find that Justice Kennedy stepped down because the Trump Administration and GOP were blackmailing him over his children. Goodbye voting rights. Good bye women's right tti choose.  Goodbye civil rights. Goodbye immigration rights. Goodbye worker rights. Goodbye consumer rights. Goodbye environmental rights.  Goodbye privacy rights.  Hello corporate dystopia. We warned you not to vote for trump, for exactly this reason (among others)... Yeah....  


But man it's a good thing we all avoided having a President Hillary Clinton.  


/s Bret Kavanaugh needs to go away forever In this brave, new, *conservative* world, there will be renewed focus on states' rights w/r/t to the federal government, with states like CA, NY, and MA leading the charge. The upcoming docket these term is INSANE.  Great article. I would argue that in the past term the conservative justices actually sided quite a bit with the other side. But considering the cases coming up, outlined in this article, that very well may change. roberts is either a bald face liar or hes delusional to say that scotus isnt political--lots of folks that voted for trump are going to hate how they lose their rights as this country is careening towards a taliban like fuck-toc-tracy--i hope the red states and precincts wake the fuck up--they wont theyre all hurr durr trump is god If the Court strips women of civil rights, we only need one more state to ratify the Equal rights amendment and make Roe moot under the 14th amendment.

This should be one of those things everyone agrees on. What's it called? Common sense. Yes please Makes sense. Doesn’t push me towards yang any though. This should already exist. I actually disagree with this. There is a lot we can learn from amassing a large amount of data and blocking it off will make research and advancement in those areas impossible. 

A good example of this is with Google Maps. Google figures out how long it's going to take you to get from point A to point B by using peoples driving data. This is data they wouldn't be able to collect if we made people's public data private. 

A prime example privatizing data is in the medical field. Medical data is so tightly controlled that doing research relying on machine learning is nearly impossible. 

I've experienced these limitations first hand. I worked on a modeling project with a local hospital where we needed to get access to fetal heart tracings. The hoops we had to go through to get even a small set of anonymize data was absurd. The project showed that our model could predict problems with a fetus before a doctor could but with such a limited dataset we weren't able to do much with it. 

This idea of a right to absolute privacy is something I think belongs in the past. We gain nothing from keeping data hidden and lose a lot of potential opportunities.","Andrew Yang proposes that your digital data be considered personal propertyI definitely would not argue with this.

Also, any president that tries to defend themselves by accusing others of wrongdoing is most likely guilty by Trump's own past tweets concerning how guilty people act.","Trump loyalists are working hard defend Trump.

She was so thankful that many of these children were now getting both a breakfast and a lunch.  Obviously she was happy they were getting food where many of them would normally not receive it, but she said it also greatly improved their grades.  Children with full bellies have bigger attention spans, especially at that young age.  They also weren’t focused on “when is my next meal”.  She said a few of them only really could count on school food.  It’s infuriating to watch our country turn its backs on those who need us most. These guys are basically Disney cartoon villains at this point. I half expect trump to start wearing a dalmatian fur coat for his next official outing Because nothing says ""Christian"" quite like fucking over poor kids to fund tax cuts for millionaires.

I love how republicans keep saying there was no quid pro quo, as if the illegal dealings of a criminal must be spelled out in no uncertain terms in order to prosecute a crime. Lets be clear here, as trumps unshakable defender Lindsey Graham once stated in reference to Bill Clinton lying about getting a blowjob, ""impeachment doesn't require a crime"".  He goes on to say that ""impeachment is about cleansing the office, restoring honor and integrity to the office"".   


Lets follow 1990's Lindsey's Graham's reasoning on this, cause 2019 Lindsey Graham makes no sense. I'm ready for some cleansing of the office. Good. Cut it off completely. No one cares ""I'll have more flexibility after the election"" At first what trump did was equal to Hillary, and now it’s far worse. I'm glad they are finally holding Trump accountable for his actions"

On a separate note, as someone who talks to a lot of conservatives, almost all of them believe in climate change (the few deniers are a small minority that are enlarged by social media like anti vaxxers) but many either don't think it's to the extent that people are saying it is, or disagree with the alarmism on the left.

364,[QUESTION] Explain Gender Identity and the explosion of new genders to me,Liberal,pakidara,t5_2qxt5,d6zkry,"I don't know all about it, but I generally view it as a form of personal freedom.  I know a lot of conservatives who want jack-booted gestapo government agents to tell individuals how they must identify (male or female).  But personally, if you identify as a pan-sapiosexual or whatever and you want to marry someone who loves you and say you both happened to be born the same physical gender, you should be able to do so.  It doesn't really affect me.  If you are a man in drag, I will probably refer to you with female pronouns, beyond that, I've never personally seen anyone get upset with the pronoun stuff people on the right claim is a huge issue. Have you heard of Contrapoints on youtube? She has a good video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hmULQc5jIw

She used to identify as male at the start of her youtube career, came out as gender queer in that video, and then came out as a transwoman later on and transitioned. She makes the best videos on youtube. 

I wouldn't take that video as gospel though, that video is 2 years old and her views have surely evolved and matured since then but it's a good starting point. 

Here's a more recent, much more in depth video with a loose focus on non-binary genders and the phrase ""transtrenders"": https://youtu.be/EdvM_pRfuFM people can be born with both sets of genitalia. Also can be born as xxy, xyy, xxx, xxyy, makes sense that they could be born with the brain of one sex and the genitalia of the other.  


They had to live in shadows for so many years, we just want to give them a voice and validate them. Clearly 50 is nonsense. I'm sure we will pare it down as the science catches up. I feel like I need a preamble not to be seen as a Conservative... So, just bare with me and my virtue signaling for a moment.  I'll then address the -actual- question, then there will be a small rant that does talk about ""PC Culture"" a little, because there are issues that need solved.  

I am pro-trans rights.  I've got a lot of stakes in the trans rights movement.   I go further in these beliefs that trans people don't -need- scientific verification.  I even think they very nature of trying to use the fact of xxy/xyy/gendered brains/ etc is a bad idea.  People do not -need- a justification for behaving.  They do not -need- a justification for augmenting their self.  That's it.  This isn't a matter of Identity.  This is a matter of getting to live your subjective experience based on whatever criteria you like, that does not bring harm to others.  

The need to justify that is based within something that needs to -prove- something to others.  And I totally understand with conservative led policy to prevent people from living their lives.  

Gender Identity is not your 'birth assignment' (Sex) When we're using -exact- language then Male/Female would be your genetic sex, and Man/Woman would be the binary gender.  

The explosion of Gender Identity is rooted in a great deal of Feminist notions from square one, when the cultural role of women was finally being noticed as oppressive and problematic.  This began before the movements were ever called ""Feminism"" of course, and there are examples of women with these types of inclinations for a long time before Sufferage.  

That was where the seeds were planted for the gender identity questions, that we're seeing arise prominently now.  Now that Gender (being a man or woman) has been revealed as the misleading notion that it is, it allows for any interpretation of your role in society.  The Nuclear Family has broken down, and there is no need for the extremes.  They were oppressive on both sides of the ""binary.""  They continue to be so.  So, people are taking what they want from the ashes of Gender, and assembling it into something they feel is themselves.  (Even if that is simply acknowledging they want no part in this - Nonbinary.)  

It absolutely makes sense that it is occurring, and socially we absolutely need to accept, acknowledge, and support these individuals.  I'm sure we've all felt similar things in our lives, when we're connected tangentially to some sense of self-identity that we -need- to separate ourselves from.   (Anytime you've ever been associated with something you're not actually a part of is a micro example.)   This is a similar feeling, to a very different degree.

My Rant.  
TLDR: Freedom of Speech is the only thing that acts as a means of self correction in Liberal Society.  It is the ONLY tool to avoid violence. We need to protect it and foster it as a priority. 

I have, certainly, met with people who want to silence the conversations. There has been a large amount of deplatforming happening on college campuses in the US just so people cannot speak their ideas. The concept of Intersectionality is totally important, because each concept involved is very important.  However, it purports to a fascist structure.  ""Believers"" (Liberals) and Non-Believers (Bigots, Transphobes, Racists, Misogynists, etc) and the believers want to -silence- the non-believers so that ideas cannot stand and be critiqued.  That's wrong, and it IS happening.

We need to be more accepting, as a community.  People are getting better, that's what people do.  If someone can accept gay rights, but still needs to ask hard questions about trans rights...then we need to let them have the conversation, because not everyone can understand right away.  But people can't be reasoned into acceptance without having the conversation, and they should not be forced to accept it or ostracized from communities.  It is OUR responsibility to have the conversations, and to change minds.   

I consider myself liberal, and I know that Freedom of Speech is the only correction mechanism for slip ups and mistakes.  So, ANY political movement that argues against the Freedom of Speech, on any grounds, is the wrong side of the argument.  

Yes, people OUGHT to use the words you prefer to be referred by.  That doesn't mean that they have to do so.  

We ought to be able to have a conversation about it, even if we disagree.  

A lot of this 'censure' is typically because people care, and I totally sympathize with that.  I do.  I very much want to protect people from pains, especially people who are more likely to be depressed and suicidal.  

That does not mean we can compromise our position on the Freedom of Speech.  There -WILL- be people on a side that disagree, and who will use inflammatory language (Dead naming, misgendering, etc)  That is not grounds for legal action.  

Short of them inciting IMMEDIATE violence, there is nothing they should not be able to say.  They should be able to suffer the social ramifications from holding bad ideas, that's fine, but there need be no legal means to silence those bad ideas. We -cannot- let Authoritarian notions rule us, even if we feel they are 'benevolent.'  

There is plenty they should not say, but people don't share the same ethical qualms.   

Just because Conservatives are ALSO making this mistake, does not mean that this mistake can be dismissed in the Liberal community.  

Silencing people is a mistake.  Even if it hurts your feelings.  

Conversation is the -only- chance we have at change without violence.  We have to build a WORLD on both sides of the aisle that will have them, and want to help people and are willing to explore options.","[QUESTION] Explain Gender Identity and the explosion of new genders to meI don't know all about it, but I generally view it as a form of personal freedom.  I know a lot of conservatives who want jack-booted gestapo government agents to tell individuals how they must identify (male or female).  But personally, if you identify as a pan-sapiosexual or whatever and you want to marry someone who loves you and say you both happened to be born the same physical gender, you should be able to do so.  It doesn't really affect me.  If you are a man in drag, I will probably refer to you with female pronouns, beyond that, I've never personally seen anyone get upset with the pronoun stuff people on the right claim is a huge issue. Have you heard of Contrapoints on youtube? She has a good video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hmULQc5jIw

She used to identify as male at the start of her youtube career, came out as gender queer in that video, and then came out as a transwoman later on and transitioned. She makes the best videos on youtube. 

I wouldn't take that video as gospel though, that video is 2 years old and her views have surely evolved and matured since then but it's a good starting point. 

Here's a more recent, much more in depth video with a loose focus on non-binary genders and the phrase ""transtrenders"": https://youtu.be/EdvM_pRfuFM people can be born with both sets of genitalia. Also can be born as xxy, xyy, xxx, xxyy, makes sense that they could be born with the brain of one sex and the genitalia of the other.  


They had to live in shadows for so many years, we just want to give them a voice and validate them. Clearly 50 is nonsense. I'm sure we will pare it down as the science catches up. I feel like I need a preamble not to be seen as a Conservative... So, just bare with me and my virtue signaling for a moment.  I'll then address the -actual- question, then there will be a small rant that does talk about ""PC Culture"" a little, because there are issues that need solved.  

I am pro-trans rights.  I've got a lot of stakes in the trans rights movement.   I go further in these beliefs that trans people don't -need- scientific verification.

A. The investments seem to be the vaults of money. Stock has massive value but how many jobs are they actually creating..  the blue chips in America? Some, but nothing relative to the investments. 

B. No one is going to take all the money. But some, sure. They will still have massive amounts to invest and save, just less. 

5 billion instead of 7 going into the stock market that creates few jobs. 

C. The wealthy will flip the fuck out though and likely cut jobs..  because they hate tax increases. It will be more emotional than factually based. So let’s tax the poor more because they do have vaults of money on hand ? 

No one is taking all of anyone’s money. It’s about paying your fair share. And this Reganomics trickle down bs has been proven to be a massive failure. For everyone except the poor downtrodden billionaires you’re so quick to defend. It's wealth redistribution. Nobody has vaults of money. If you're on the lower end of the income scale and you get more money you spend it on stuff. Redistribution would mean better times for small and medium sized businesses the kind of businesses that create jobs. The wealthiest and the largest companies don't create jobs they actually do the opposite (on average, of course). They mostly grow by cannibalizing smaller companies.

A lot of the largest fortunes are never invested in active production but rather in speculative business.

That's why the bailouts should *not* go to failed banks but to the consumers who would lift up the economy easily through their support of SMEs. 1929 black days occurred because there weren’t *enough* holding requirements. Banks were able to gamble their deposits on the stock market without having to ensure a suitable amount on hand. Consumers were taking out loans to play the market, certain that once they made a killing they could pay it back. It all worked great while the market stayed high but once it crashed suddenly liquidity was gone because the banks didn’t have enough left in their holdings so they called in loans from people who couldn’t pay them because they lost it all on the market. This created a panic that caused a run on the banks that made the crisis that much worse. Is this a low effort troll? Literally read this sub My father was a corporate accountant for 45+ years. I have been lectured on this so many times I can't count them. The thing is we tax the hell out of the wealthy and corporations. The we throw in all of those tax loopholes so many people complain about. This way they either pay taxes or they spend their money in ways that keep an economy chugging along. Our tax system right now is seriously flawed as the low tax rates make it more less likely the wealthy and corporation will spend their money which means too much money will be consolidated and not flowing in our economy.

When we do what some people call spreading the wealth it works like this. Tax those that make a lot of money, give it to those with less then they spend it on the things they need thus giving it back to people that make a lot of money. The money keeps moving, companies are selling more goods and services which makes the stock prices rise and that is building wealth.

>Soon after the massacre in El Paso last month, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas staked out a new position on gun control: He said as president, he would institute mandatory buybacks of firearms considered assault weapons. Asked about the position during Thursday night’s Democratic primary debate, Mr. O’Rourke did not mince words:

448,Should there be a wealth limit?,Liberal,Mrjsg,t5_2qxt5,d39lma,"Start out with something absurd. E.g.,could one person own the entire planet? Nope people would not put up with that. All right then, can one person own an entire country? I don't think people would put up with that either. Then can one person own an entire resource so that no one else can have access to it without their permission? Nope.  In any event once you get beyond a few million dollars it's not really money anymore, it's raw power.  So the real question is: how much raw power is any one individual allowed to have over all the rest of us? If we were to just flat out take 50% of the wealth of anyone worth over 1 Billion dollars we would not affect their lifestyle one bit.

FYI I am not advocating we should do this I am only pointing it out. So, a company worth more than $3 billion could never be owned by an individual?  Let's say an individually-owned company is valued at $3.5 billion. How would you 'slice off' the $500 million from that company to give to others?  Do you force the owner to sell a $500 million interest in the company and be forced to give that money to the government?  What happens if the company subsequently shrinks to a $2 billion valuation?  Now the original owner only owns $1.7 billion of that company.  Should he then be able to force the $500 million buyer to sell back his share for the remaining $300 million?  Of course that original owner would not have the $300 million because the government took every penny he had over the original $3 billion valuation of his company.

I personally think your idea is flawed.  It is a bad idea to destroy the incentive to accumulate wealth.  It was bad enough in the 60's when there was a 90% income tax rate.  This idea is much worse. Yes, there should. Nobody needs billions and billions of dollars, and it should be absolutely illegal that someone should have such money and funds when people in the same country struggle with basic needs such as food, healthcare, and transportation. I get the concept, but rather than cash grants to poor people, the money should be re-invested in things like infrastructure, education, healthcare, etc. Not just giving people a chunk of change. This is literally what they were doing in soviet union. If somebody got too rich, his money were taken. At least as it applies to income taxes, or a wealth tax as Warren proposes, yes. It’s essentially a “luck tax”.  While earning lots of money is an incentive to work hard and succeed, earning ass loads of money isn’t. Earning ass loads of money is really just a matter of luck. 

Telling a young Steve Jobs that he’s never going to be able to keep more than a billion dollars a year isn’t going to make him rethink his career choices. Telling a young David Geffen that he’s only going to be able to keep his first three billion is not going to stop him from forming Asylum Records and signing The Eagles. 

I think that, when it comes right down to it, it’s almost impossible to find an instance where the decisions that turned someone into a millionaire can be separated from those which ultimately made them a billionaire. It’s almost as if there’s an event horizon beyond which someone like Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos really had no control over the exponential growth of their wealth. Taxing it drastically beyond a certain level literally can’t de-incentivize anyone. LOL Sounds like communist propaganda to me, but whatever. Wealth inequality itself is not a problem. It only becomes a problem when that inequality turns into tyranny. Seizing wealth by force is also tyrannical, and so is imposing a limit on wealth. 

How about instead of attacking wealth, which itself is not a problem, you attack tyranny. An interesting thought, but what means would the government use to SEIZE this money? I like the premise. However, there would have to be loopholes for different businesses, corporations, LLC's etc. Also, would it encompass only liquid assets such as money in the bank? What about investments? Otherwise, we'd need to break up a lot of companies which would never happen in America.","Should there be a wealth limit?Start out with something absurd. E.g.,could one person own the entire planet?

And recessions happen all the time; they're a natural event in economics. People should expect them to happen after a decently long time of the economy booming. They shouldn't weigh in on peoples opinions on a President unless said President's actions are what caused it, which usually isn't the case. In this instance, almost certainly is, but in general the President's approval shouldn't be so tied to the economy.

What approval ratings should be tied to is using the constitution as toilet paper. I will probably get downvoted for this but just one poll isn't going to give you the clearest representation.

These things bother me because they take one poll that has him at 40 when before they had him at 47. More than one poll has been conducted and all aggregate polls show he has barely moved, sadly. I want his approval to shrink but this isn't it.

When his aggregate, partisan, recency, and sample size adjusted polls start showing him tanking then crack out the champagne! For now, we still have a lot of hearts and minds to change. 

Talk to people who you disagree with. Give personal examples when talking about your opinions to prevent compassion fatigue. The second you make a person bring up their defenses your ability to make positive change drastically lowers. Talk as if you are convincing them that you genuinely want what is best for them (which you should anyway)

We can do this guys!


Thank you kind stranger for the silver 😀💙 Sorry to get off topic but it really grinds my gears when news articles don't simplify their numbers. It's 3 out of 5, not 6 out of 10. Go figure.  The media speculates about the economy possibly slowing, and people are concerned.  In other news, water is wet. Are these the same pollsters that said he didn't have a chance in 2016? Trump supporters and Rwpublicans will welcome a global depression if it means owning liberals. Friendly reminder that we don't go by individual polls, and that we pay attention instead to the average. I hope the economy goes into recession so Trump loses the election. [deleted] Didn’t more than that say trump would lose?","6 in 10 call a recession likely; Trump approval drops by 6 points: PollIf groups that are viewed as an authority on information, such as Media outlets and sponsored think tanks, continue to say a recession is likely it will damage consumer confidence. Damaging consumer confidence is one of the main issues that cause recessions. So, this is very much a self-fulfilling prophecy if they continue to beat the drum. Obama's economy, the longest bull economy ever, is still robust and still pounding away despite this nitwit trying to sabotage it. We will be fine if we start to invest in infrastructure and raise workers' wages. Polls are bullshit, according to Penn and Teller 


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=If9EWDB_zK4 A recession would screw me and my entire generation over right now, but I’m almost willing to let it happen so that this buffoon can be voted out and someone who accepts that the planet has gone beyond warming and progressed to cooking can become president. Title could use some more detail.  6 in 10 what?  Economists?  Americans?  Republicans?

Then over time, her reasonings turned more and more hateful until she openly claimed that all gay people are ABOMINATIONS, that agendered bathrooms mean trans-people are allowed to use them which she and her children find DISGUSTING, and that she wants the government to be a theocracy.

The first two are direct quotes, the third is a summation of her ideas on how government should work. Apparently all politicians should be christian and the laws she thinks should be passed should only reflect her ""christian"" beliefs.

Point being, you can try to convince yourself you're only following the guy because of his policy/business/whatever ""harmless"" thing, but when a president openly calls political opponents racist slurs, incites violence at his rallies, and uses white supremacist symbols in his own political advertising, you can't split those up. You cannot have just his policies without also having all his hate. You can only have both or neither, because that is a large part of who he has defined himself as and what he has defended time and time again.

If you defend Trump, you are defending his homophobia and racism; I believe that makes you complicit, thus making you just as homophobic and racist. This is a very interesting question. Just some context, i'm subbed here as well as /r/Conservative. I live in Austin and consider myself extremely liberal.

For those who do think every Trump supporter is a racist:

Beliefs like this are why people vote for Trump. Criticize that in and of itself, but it's the truth, and I can sympathize with people who do.  This belief comes off as extraordinarily condescending, and frankly, displays a tremendous lack of any kind of thought outside of a hyper-liberal bubble. Go out and talk to some actual Trump supporters, which there are plenty of, and you may be surprised.

Some people, like my parents, like him because he's tough on China. Go ahead and call that belief racist, but please make sure to bring a solid argument because I have been reading the /r/Sino subreddit for a loooong time.

Some people like the idea of a businessman in office, and not a career politician. I can certainly see why people like this.

To be honest, I think the biggest reason, is people are tired of being treated like they are racist and bigots. I have to actually watch my tongue where I live when I say he didn't do something that was terrible. I think being afraid of open discussions is one of the most terrifying things in a free speech society.

I'm not voting for Trump, but he is going to win this election by an even larger margin than the last one. So keep calling people racists, but just remember you really are slowing down liberal progress. No. In same the same way I don't think everyone who votes for a Democrat supports abortion or taking away guns, I don't think everyone who supports Trump is a racist or xenophobic. The GOP has done a fantastic job convincing their base that liberal policies are racist because they ""want to just give money to black people to keep them quiet"". You don't have to be objectively racist to be influenced by racist policies and rhetoric. The GOP has masterfully manipulated voters into supporting them even if those same voters don't necessarily believe or support what they're voting for. That said, there are absolutely a lot of racists who are very open about it that do support Trump. Is every Trump voter a racist? No. Is every racist a Trump supporter? No. Trump has unequivocally demonstrated that he is a racist. I believe that racism is the key motivator that led to Trump’s rise to power. He reflects the very worst of America and racism is at its core. Every one? That may be a bit of a stretch. There are exceptions to every rule. 

I believe that rasicm is as much a foundation of trump's ideas as social programs and wealthy taxation are for Democrats. Some Democrats may not agree with higher taxes on the wealthy or social programs, but it's a pretty obvious part of the party. Yes and you should hear me out.

Even if they aren't card carrying KKK members, or they don't harbor racist thoughts, or any of the usual things we use to determine someone's ""not a racist"" status, they still support a man who very much is a racism.

If Trump's racism is not a deal breaker than you're pretty much as bad. Trump is proven criminal filth for decades on end. Republicans are proven political filth for a minimum decade now. I believe supporters are sheep. A complete net negative regarding anything honorable or useful. Answer me this. What do you call it when you vote for someone when you know they are heavily endorsed by the kkk and white supremacist.   Dont you feel that's a deal breaker when electing a president.   To me voting with the kkk is a big teller on who your base is. Why else would they support him? I do not believe that everyone who supports Trump is a racist. Everyone who supports Trump at least *tolerates* racism to some degree, but they may not be racist themselves. Why do they support him? If he said fron the beginning that he wouldn't stand for racism would they support him? Many are genuinely misinformed. Doesn't excuse them much, but I wouldn't call them virulent, hateful, or racist. Just ignorant and dangerous.  I would say the majority are. One way to find out is to ask a trump supporter if they think trump is a racist. If they say no then that person is most certainly a bigot or a fool. There is absolutely no ambiguity in trump's bigotry he solidifies it on a weekly if not daily basis. Oh, probably not every single one. I suppose there's a number of his supporters who don't think of themselves as racist or homophobic or whatever. However, unless we're talking about those few of his supporters who are motivated by pure cynical self-interest (i.e. the very rich who simply wanted a giant catastrophic tax cut), I would say that all the rest of his supporters certainly have one commonality:

They have a flaw in their reasoning, a mistaken assumption or unwarranted premise, that blinds them to the *actual* results and consequences of this support. I can't believe that anyone genuinely wants to live in a condition of drastic economic disaster, with huge racial unrest and widespread desperation, in a nation with no hope while nearly all of the rest of the world hates us. Yes. Absolutely. I think you have to look at this sort of thing in orders of magnitude.

A first order consequence is where you directly do something. There are plenty of racists who support Trump, but I don't think most do. A second order consequence would be something like voting for someone who is racist. If you hire a racist to do something you haven't directly supported racism. Just like if I buy a piece of clothing from a company that employs sweatshop child workers, I don't directly support child sweat shops. However, I certainly do in some ways support them. Condoning and tolerating racism is certainly not the same as being a direct supporter. However, since Trump has such a wildly different political stance than any other Republican in the past, I really have to wonder if Republicans ever had anything that they stood for. However racism seems to be an enduring trend. There is no such thing as degrees of racism. E.g being ' a little' racist or ' a lot' racist' . Its binary. You either believe all humans are the same or you believe that somehow another race is somehow inferior to yourself.  With that in mind, i can say that majority of Trump supporters i have come accross are racist. I do believe that EVERY trump supporter is a racist. At least at this point in time, I do. I can give a little bit of leeway for those who voted for him in 2016, but only a little bit. At best I accuse 2016 tRump voters, who are rethinking their choice now, of being naive, uninformed or just ignorant. But by now, anybody who still supports tRump is a raging and undeniable racist. His attitudes, his speech, his policies, his behaviors, his rallies, all of it screams white supremacist racist narcissist and anybody who still supports him is actively supporting his agenda. I don't care if you go to rallies and are a proud racist or you keep your attitudes quiet and internal and then go and enact your hate as a voting booth racist. The reality is that if you vote for this piece of shit in any capacity, if his actions don't turn your stomach and make you angry as hell, then you are a racist, plain and simple. If you passively take advantage of the oppression of others made policy by this president, then you are a racist.

On this there is no gray area. Not now. Not ever again. We know what he stands for. And we know what support of it means. Definitely not, alot of my family and most trump suppoters arent racist, they either only care about the politician, not there actions, or just like him cuz he is republican, but he does have quite a few awful people who support him, what im trying to say is if you are republican you arent automatically racist I love trump and I support him. According to the comments, millions of Americans are racist. Back then being called a racist was a HUGE thing and it could ruin someone’s life for while. When people call me a racist or a homophobe or a white supremacist, I take it with a grain of salt. Has trump said shady things yes? Am I racist? No. Yes. 

I have a brother in law, sister in law, and father in law that are die hard Trump supporters and ""only at the dinner table"" racists. They are all upper, middle class people, so I am going to go ahead and pigeon hole here...if they are...all of them are. I used to believe they were gullibles who were fooled by a NYC real estate shyster. But now 3 yrs later, I've found if you dig deep enough, yes you'll find racism as well. I support Trump's policies, but my God, he needs to delete his Twitter and burn his phone.  I'm not a racist by the way.

In reality, it never should have gotten to the point where Trump was a viable candidate.  I think Trump's nomination and win was a reaction to having 2 moderate, mostly good candidates (McCain and Romney) declared racist, sexist, and whatever other forms of bigotry were being thrown around.
There's only so many times you can accuse your opponent of that before your opponent says ""ok, they won't stop slinging mud, let's nominate a mud wrestler"".  And Trump was the backlash. Of course not. There's no way EVERY Trumo supporter is racist, and I agree that a whole lot of people vote for him based on Republican policies that he supports.

However, Trump has most certainly outed himself as a racist and as supporting, or at least not having a problem with white nationalism. Or, maybe he just doesn't understand what white nationalism is. That's also possible.

If you're a Trump supporter, though, you are supporting racism and racist policies, the most glaring of which are the concentration camps of **legal entrants to the US seeking asylum**.

This is a travesty on par with the internment of Japanese citizens during World War II.

Supporting Trump and all the people that help him is supporting racism, whether you like it or not.

I don't believe you're a racist if you say you aren't, but supporting Republicans and Trump is supporting racism. If a priest gives a sermon on treating others as you want to be treated, but then goes back behind closed doors and boofs an altar boy, wouldn’t you question his teachings? “Well I supported him because he throws jokes in his sermons and that keeps me upbeat, so if boofing kids is what it takes I guess I’ll buy some astroglide.”

Some people just draw their lines closer to the side that gives a fuck about EVERYBODY. I've yet to meet one who isn't. One of my former close friends is a trumpster and I had to end that friendship when he admitted to being against gay marriage and started dropping the N word frequently. Claiming that all Trump supporters are racist is ridiculous of course. However, claiming that all racists support Trump is a lot more reasonable in my opinion. No. But they're all willing to look the other way regarding racism. There's racists on both sides.


I'm hispanic and support Trump. I personally believe that if you think someone who's white and supports Trump is automatically racist makes you racist. I believe if you support Trump and are not a racist yourself, you demonstrate that you at least dont care about racism.

Trump himself is a racist. His cabinet is filled with racists. And many of his supporters are racists. If the people who get offended at being called racist actually cared that much about racism, I dont see how they can support him. I'm at a loss to imagine why else they would support him. Trump is a racist and, since you support him,  **You Are A Racist, Too!**","Do you believe every Trump supporter is racist?Yes I do from my own personal experience with it.

At best I accuse 2016 tRump voters, who are rethinking their choice now, of being naive, uninformed or just ignorant. But by now, anybody who still supports tRump is a raging and undeniable racist. His attitudes, his speech, his policies, his behaviors, his rallies, all of it screams white supremacist racist narcissist and anybody who still supports him is actively supporting his agenda. I don't care if you go to rallies and are a proud racist or you keep your attitudes quiet and internal and then go and enact your hate as a voting booth racist. The reality is that if you vote for this piece of shit in any capacity, if his actions don't turn your stomach and make you angry as hell, then you are a racist, plain and simple. If you passively take advantage of the oppression of others made policy by this president, then you are a racist.

On this there is no gray area. Not now. Not ever again. We know what he stands for. And we know what support of it means. Definitely not, alot of my family and most trump suppoters arent racist, they either only care about the politician, not there actions, or just like him cuz he is republican, but he does have quite a few awful people who support him, what im trying to say is if you are republican you arent automatically racist I love trump and I support him. According to the comments, millions of Americans are racist. Back then being called a racist was a HUGE thing and it could ruin someone’s life for while. When people call me a racist or a homophobe or a white supremacist, I take it with a grain of salt. Has trump said shady things yes? Am I racist? No. Yes. 

I have a brother in law, sister in law, and father in law that are die hard Trump supporters and ""only at the dinner table"" racists. They are all upper, middle class people, so I am going to go ahead and pigeon hole here...if they are...all of them are. I used to believe they were gullibles who were fooled by a NYC real estate shyster. But now 3 yrs later, I've found if you dig deep enough, yes you'll find racism as well. I support Trump's policies, but my God, he needs to delete his Twitter and burn his phone.  I'm not a racist by the way.

In reality, it never should have gotten to the point where Trump was a viable candidate.  I think Trump's nomination and win was a reaction to having 2 moderate, mostly good candidates (McCain and Romney) declared racist, sexist, and whatever other forms of bigotry were being thrown around.
There's only so many times you can accuse your opponent of that before your opponent says ""ok, they won't stop slinging mud, let's nominate a mud wrestler"".  And Trump was the backlash. Of course not. There's no way EVERY Trumo supporter is racist, and I agree that a whole lot of people vote for him based on Republican policies that he supports.

However, Trump has most certainly outed himself as a racist and as supporting, or at least not having a problem with white nationalism. Or, maybe he just doesn't understand what white nationalism is. That's also possible.

If you're a Trump supporter, though, you are supporting racism and racist policies, the most glaring of which are the concentration camps of **legal entrants to the US seeking asylum**.

This is a travesty on par with the internment of Japanese citizens during World War II.

Supporting Trump and all the people that help him is supporting racism, whether you like it or not.

I don't believe you're a racist if you say you aren't, but supporting Republicans and Trump is supporting racism. If a priest gives a sermon on treating others as you want to be treated, but then goes back behind closed doors and boofs an altar boy, wouldn’t you question his teachings? “Well I supported him because he throws jokes in his sermons and that keeps me upbeat, so if boofing kids is what it takes I guess I’ll buy some astroglide.”

Some people just draw their lines closer to the side that gives a fuck about EVERYBODY. I've yet to meet one who isn't. One of my former close friends is a trumpster and I had to end that friendship when he admitted to being against gay marriage and started dropping the N word frequently. Claiming that all Trump supporters are racist is ridiculous of course. However, claiming that all racists support Trump is a lot more reasonable in my opinion. No. But they're all willing to look the other way regarding racism. There's racists on both sides.


I'm hispanic and support Trump. I personally believe that if you think someone who's white and supports Trump is automatically racist makes you racist. I believe if you support Trump and are not a racist yourself, you demonstrate that you at least dont care about racism.

Trump himself is a racist. His cabinet is filled with racists. And many of his supporters are racists. If the people who get offended at being called racist actually cared that much about racism, I dont see how they can support him. I'm at a loss to imagine why else they would support him. Trump is a racist and, since you support him,  **You Are A Racist, Too!**"

Unfortunately, if impeached, the Senate will never convict him - fucking Republicans will brush off or ignore everything and then Trump'd declare ""exoneration!!!"".

And there have already been repercussions from this act.

15 May 2018, on the advice of right-wing, false-Christian Evangelicals spewing Dominionist dogma,  Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy there, breaking a long-standing treaty agreement with Palestine, which led to an uprising and several DEATHS.

Trump has since been hailed by these Evangelical Dominionists as their ""cornerstone"" twisting a Bible verses Isaiah 28:16-17 and more importantly 1 Peter 2:4-8, implying that Trump is no less than Christ returned.  This in addition to loudly declaring Trump to be the ""savior of Israel"", and ""The chosen one"".

Separation of church and state!!!!! If churches want to be politically active they can pay taxes. If they want to keep their tax exemption then they need to stay the hell out of politics.

No. He began his spree after:

•	⁠calling the FBI and police with a wackadoodle rant https://twitter.com/AP/status/1168602021391413248

•	⁠being fired - https://news.sky.com/story/texas-gunman-was-sacked-from-job-hours-before-killing-seven-people-11800507

•	⁠THEN the traffic stop

Point is a lot of things went wrong in that mans life *and* warning signs were ignored *and* clear actionable calls to do something were ignored.

EDIT - From https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/west-texas-shooting-odessa-midland/index.html about halfway down :

Alonzo said she called police after the incident last month, but that  they had never responded because the location of the property does not  show up on GPS and is difficult to find.

Please don't ban me. The point is that the gun control response is, frankly, impotent when the laws we have aren't being enforced in a way to prevent this. 

Let's close the private sale loop hole and hold law enforcement accountable! Texas doesn’t require background checks on **any** private sales or transfers. As long as the seller doesn’t *knowingly* sell to someone who can’t buy guns, the sale is perfectly legal (from the sellers end). So until universal background checks require everyone to find out, you just sell the gun and hope for the best. *Ah am mortified, just mortified, that a person could get a weapon so easily here in Texas!*

**What steps are you going to take to prevent future spree shootings?**

Greg Abbott knows that most private gun sales in Texas don’t require background checks.> The gunman  began his random shooting spree on Saturday after being pulled over by  police.

No. He began his spree after:

•	⁠failing a NICS check - https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/459678-texas-gov-abbott-odessa-shooter-previously-failed-gun-background-check

•	⁠calling the FBI and police with a wackadoodle rant https://twitter.com/AP/status/1168602021391413248

•	⁠having a neighbor report issues like shooting from the roof https://nypost.com/2019/09/01/texas-mass-shooter-threatened-neighbor-shot-animals-from-roof-report/ and https://apnews.com/eef251ac02a74cb7ba195f83a9494c45?utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SocialFlow

•	⁠having no utilities (repeat link) https://nypost.com/2019/09/01/texas-mass-shooter-threatened-neighbor-shot-animals-from-roof-report/

•	⁠being fired - https://news.sky.com/story/texas-gunman-was-sacked-from-job-hours-before-killing-seven-people-11800507

•	⁠THEN the traffic stop

Point is a lot of things went wrong in that mans life *and* warning signs were ignored *and* clear actionable calls to do something were ignored.

EDIT - From https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/west-texas-shooting-odessa-midland/index.html about halfway down :

Alonzo said she called police after the incident last month, but that  they had never responded because the location of the property does not  show up on GPS and is difficult to find.

Please don't ban me. The point is that the gun control response is, frankly, impotent when the laws we have aren't being enforced in a way to prevent this. 

Let's close the private sale loop hole and hold law enforcement accountable! Texas doesn’t require background checks on **any** private sales or transfers. As long as the seller doesn’t *knowingly* sell to someone who can’t buy guns, the sale is perfectly legal (from the sellers end). So until universal background checks require everyone to find out, you just sell the gun and hope for the best. *Ah am mortified, just mortified, that a person could get a weapon so easily here in Texas!*

**What steps are you going to take to prevent future spree shootings?**

*Well, we should not act now, while we are all upset. We need to wait and address this problem with clearer heads.*

Are you registered to vote?

Do you know where to go?

Have any favorites for the primary? Idiot, senile psychopath sounds like an idiot, senile psychopath. More at 11 Listening to Trump speak is like taking a set of coherent statements, translating them from English to Mandarin in google translate, then having a dog try to read them back to you while it’s translating the statements back to English on the fly. Trump might actually be senile but...

Incoherence is a feature and not a bug of extremist populism. There are a couple benefits here for populists. Firstly, followers will fill in an explanation using their own cognitive dissonance, so the leader will always be correct in their minds and the leader in their mind will magically always agree with that follower’s opinions.

On the other hand, anyone who questions the coherence of the leader fails the loyalty test and can be exiled from the party. Be best! Impeach already. maybe Fox News will explain it to him...oh wait they don't understand either. 'Stunning'. You keep using that word. How is his space force coming? Ummmm I’m fairly sure he has some mental issues going on... What a fucking circus. Who is stunned? He's always this fecklessly retarded. btw...how can the GOP and the Trumpers deny that Trump was anything besides Putin's cheerleader during the G7?  he kissed Putin's ass so often you would think Putin was the President of the United States and not Trump...with some praise for Kim Jong Un sprinkled in. Cocaine's a hell of a drug and back home...every day. This all kinda makes sense though when you look at it through Trumps world view. He sees everything as a business negotiation.  No not a real one, a Trump Business Deal. The kind where he calls you a cheap cock sucker and questions your parentage while negotiating.  Then expect you to smile and hug him like a life long friend at the PR announcement that afternoon.  

So Trump probably sees it as his roll to  insult then play best buds with Xi, depending on what he thinks will help at the moment.

When the Presidential Election happened back in 2016, I wasn't really invested in either candidate, nor did I trust them to do a good job, and thus I didn't vote. I didn't care much for Hilary, nor did I trust her anymore than I did Trump at the time, and would've preferred someone like Warren or Sanders to represent the Democratic side. So when Trump got elected, I figured that things would be a bit rocky, but overall his presidency would just be another moment in history that we could look back on and laugh about now and then. 

It hasn't been until the past couple of months that he's seriously gotten on my nerves, and its because of his economic policies. Going back to at least the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and up to the Presidency of Barack Obama, every President has been mostly against Protectionist economic policies because everyone seemed to be in agreement that they were bad ideas. Yet here we are with a President who is recklessly pursuing them, and I don't even know why at this point. 

The fact that he's seemingly doubling down on his economic policies in spite of the clear long-term consequences for both the national and global economy has been the breaking point for me. I believe two things will prevent any kind of solution until at least next year:

1) China - they are not fans of Trump and would really like to see someone else in office who would be a better partner and wouldn’t openly criticize Xi. They are going to do anything they can to hurt the US economy to either a) get him to the negotiating table or b) get him out of office because the economy is suffering. However, they can’t take it too far or they risk popping their housing bubble or causing internal unrest.

2) Trump - can’t back down or he looks weak, and it’d be an admission that it was a stupid idea in the first place. Needs to hold out for a win, but can’t take it too far, lest he crash the economy in an election year. He may have very few good options, other than hold out for a mediocre deal or worse deal than he could have got in the first place, and claim victory. Still, due to #1, there is little chance of this happening.

In other words, expect it to get a lot worse before it gets better. what hasn't Trump made worse?

Megadonors such as the Kochs were able to grow their influence after the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which allowed unlimited spending, both directly and indirectly, by outside groups”

...End Citizens United! Remember that time he accidentally helped prove that Medicare for All would save us trillions of dollars over our current system?

I do.  Dust in the wind. ""And all your money won't another minute buy"" Lucifer had chills down his spine when he saw his new reservations list. ""Philanthropist"". Ding dong the witch is dead. A sad little man has died. He spent the last years of his life worried about his fortune instead of enjoying life with friends and family. A sad little man has died. Good riddance. Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. All that money still couldn’t save him. You hate to see it."

Liberals believe in the sanctity of the human body and persons right to it.

Liberals believe social and science spending have a huge impact on economic growth.

Liberals know science is method of examining the world and don’t need to believe in it as it is not a religion just observations and theories.

Liberals are not afraid of change.

Liberals don’t see the past through rose colored glasses nor do they worship a mythical glorious past.

Liberals have high hopes for the future.

Liberals are not afraid of other people or groups of people. If you want to have a debate it’s your responsibility to start it. We’ll be glad to engage you. 

You’ve thrown a stick of dynamite into a room and said - Let’s discuss explosions. 

Dear Mods - as much as I’m happy to engage even the most ardent conservative allowing people to troll should be stopped. Trump is a fool, a bigot and a terrible business person. Bernie has some great ideas but I do not believe he would be an effective President. I would like to see the numbers of abortions reduced by raising the education level and economic standards of all Americans. I am not a bigot so transgender people do not bother me. That’s pretty broad, could you narrow it down to something specific. [removed]"

744,Are Mass Shootings Becoming More Common? | Psychology Today,Liberal,EliteGamer1337,t5_2qxt5,crz12h,"This is why I read the last paragraph first. 

>Toward that end, I have offered no answers, but rather some thoughts meant merely to productively complicate a picture that I think many of us on all sides believe to be all too simple. 8 out of the 10 deadliest mass shootings happened in my lifetime and my generation is just starting to run for the highest office in the land and they consider him too young. We won't forget what we saw and the inaction of those who preceded us. The amount of shootings may not fluctuate but they are becoming more deadly and they are at least in some cases preventable. Thanks for that metric that doesn't even fucking matter.

The fact is that the USA has a death rate due to firearms of 12.21 per 100,000 people.

Mexico's is 7.64.

Sweden (where American fascists claim is so dangerous) has a rate of 1.6 per 100,000.

The problem is guns. The problem has always been guns.

While that's fair, I have a hard time considering anything less than 10 people as significant anymore. There are mass shootings, and then there are MASS shootings. The US is actually lower than a lot of European countries for “persons died in a mass shooting per capita.” But people always focus on the amount that has happened. An analogy is like if you compare 2 football teams and their turnovers but one football team has played 3 games and the other team has played 10. The team that played 10 games may have more turnovers, just due to having sooooo many more games played and people would be quick to judge them as being far worse. But what you fail to look it as that there is a team with 3 games played and almost just as much turnovers. So who really is better? Psychology Today is so awesome.

Omar and Tlaib from visiting the country,Liberal,LageNomAiNomAi,t5_2qxt5,cqsf9f,"Usual filth from the new trump party Super politically ambiguous, but unfortunately I do recognize the rationale Bibi is using. The Israeli government is an affront to the Zionism Israel was founded upon, to the Jewish faith, and to liberalism in general. These women, however, have been condemned by most mainstream Democratic politicians as their words tend to be heavily laden with antisemitism. Most mainstream media has done the same. I’ve come to think of these two women’s rhetorics as a sort of correlate to Trump’s: the men who’ve taken up arms in the name of white supremacy or antisemitism have found their ideology validated by Trump, and it’s not unlikely that extremists in the territories would find two American representative’s words validating their own. 

By writing all of this I do not infer the validity of Israeli nor Palestinian claims of self-determination. Yes, I’m a liberal Zionist, but don’t mistake that for supporting the Israeli government’s scheming racism and illiberalism.","Israel bars Muslim Reps.

810,question fo liberals,Liberal,mayatalluluh,t5_2qxt5,cq4yg4,"I see it was removed from the other sub. Maybe that provides a little insight into why we feel like we cant communicate with the right anymore. I find it hilarious that they removed your post from /r/conservative, we're willing to discuss and they throw it out the window because it has the L word on it. It seems like a natural reaction to decades of being called traitors instead of being properly debated. You compare Obama's and Trump's rhetoric (or Bill Clinton's and W's) when discussing the other party and you'll see a huge difference. Obama made efforts to reach out to people and understand where the right was coming from. Trump is a full-blown conspiracy theorist who primarily speaks in insults.

Before that, there's also a lot of frustration because of the power imbalance between the two sides. Dems regularly get as many or more votes in Congress, but are a semi-permanent minority in the Senate because our system is based on geography instead of proportional representation. The longer you keep power away from the majority, the more the resentment builds. Growing up right, and now left, the conflict starts with a few key issues that seem to hook people into a chain of thinking. Should anyone have full access to all guns? Sould women not be allowed to abort their child? Should religious text play a bigger role in government? Are corporations more important than people? Sould businesses have the right to compensate workers as they see fit? Should workers have no right to gather, unionize, collaborate or strike? 


If you said yes to any of those questions, you're likely conservitive and don't understand why liberals would disagree. 



Liberals would look at those questions and wonder why we have to actually debate these things because Scientifically and historically these are all very bad things. 


Liberals value people and science. Government's and businesses can be remade, baseless opinions shouldn't be valid. It's why Liberals constantly want high quality care and education for the people first, so those people can work effectivity and have a good exsistance in general.



Conservitives care about the group, the leader, nationalism and religion. People don't need to be well educated or cared for. They only need to be maintained just enough to do their job and follow instructions. Using religion and the idea that they are coming to take something from you, to harm your family, to defile our worship, to change the great things we have. Suffering is a good thing, and to stop being poor you just have to work harder. I don’t like how engrained religion is with the right. I believe society is better when there’s a strong division and someone telling me what I can or can’t do with my body (example: abortion) based on gender really grinds my gears. Furthermore I find it super hypocritical that they even care in the first place cause aren’t they supposed to be all about small government? 

Also I agree with some of the other posts, hate is a strong word. Mostly I assume a republican has had a very specific life experience or they can’t read, but I don’t hate unless they’re a real asshole or a nazi (which isn’t a good look for the right either, lets be honest) Climate change is a good microcosm of left vs. right beliefs.

The Right wants to pretend it doesn't exist and is actively making it worse by rolling back all environmental protections. The center wants to do as little as possible but still work incrementally the right direction without sacrificing the comforts of status quo. The Left wants to take action before it's too late for our planet by listening to plans from the 99.9% of climate scientists from all around the globe who agree on this.

If you plan on ever having children it's not extreme to believe the American Right-wing (right wingers in other countries tend to know better) is happily going about destroying their future in the name of today's profits. I have no political affiliation. I’ve voted both sides and have registered both sides. I really hated being vilified as unamerican for not supporting w’s policies. I respect others who disagree and can form a cogent argument. Those that attack and vilify get what they ask for. I don't hate the right, I don't care for their ideas, I think for the most part, they are completely on everything.

But love our country, they're just miss informed, and gullible. I don't hate conservatives. I hate people that expect others to conform to rules that they won't conform to themselves. 

As an example, anyone that wholeheartedly believes you can discriminate against LGBT people bc it's against your own religion, and also believes it's ok to ban anyone from a different religion from this country does not deserve respect or attention. It's impossible to discuss anything in good faith with someone who selectively applies the rules. Hate is a strong word and I wouldn’t say I hate Republicans. We all have an idea of what we want our country to be. Personally I want our country to prosper with diversity while believing we are all created equal.  I have a strong intolerance of intolerant people. I find it increasingly difficult to have respect for people who want to deny others basic rights bc of their sexual orientation, immigration status or religion.  I find a majority of republicans to be religious hypocrites. They speak of God’s love yet vote for a man who spews venom and hatred.  Our government has to represent all of us equally.   We have witnessed some of the most divisive rhetoric recently.  It’s a daily occurrence to see a video or tweet of racist nonsense.  We cannot be tolerant of that and it seems at times that some republicans are willing to overlook that racism simply to have a republican in the WH. Personally I dont think there are ""Sides"" that hates the other ""side"" so much.

Liberal and conservative are very very broad terms. There are too many different opinions Grouped in up in the single words especially when there are millions of people all across the spectrum of ideology (Liberal<--------->conservative). some people have different ideologies depending on the issue at hand, probably like me you andmany others.

Its like saying you are either light skinned are dark skinned, when theres like an infinte amount of shades and tints.

People should say instead of ""I am a Liberal/conservative"" they should say ""I have a liberal/conservative opinion on that specific subject or matter""

Now with that said, to answer your question the best I can.

It's specific people who believe there are a defined Left side and defined Right side to represent a social ideology and activly voice their negative opinion of an idea they feel belongs to the other side. ""their opponent""

So I think the idea that they're are sides is a misconception. Not saying its anyones fault becuase thats just how were are delivered the information, that most people take for face value.

At the end of the day we all want the same things. Sense of security, comfort and the ability to grow unabstructed. and we are all on the same side. Unfortunatley it's become our culture where most people view those with an opposing approach to to what they feel is the most effective solution to a problem, as a direct enemy.

Those unable or unwilling to move beyond that mentality ""take sides"" so they can have support from people they think shares their interest and trust to make it easier to color the enemy in one bright color. This is'nt just politics. This is in almost everything we do here in america.

It's the easy way out compared to, taking the hours and hours it takes to set aside the ego, listen, communicate and learn to understand why an idea we think ineffective is viewed as appropriate by your fellow citizen. compromising and coming to an agreement that benifits as many many people as possible as well as is in the best interest for the purpetuality of this nation.

Edit: I could be wrong, I'm pretty uninformed when it comes to politics nowadays. I just collect bottle caps and repair consumer electronics for a living.

Glad you asked this, Id really like more people to think about this often.

Edit 2: also sometimes people just hate a specific person who claimes to be from a side and then automaticly to people they paint everyone in that group like that one person.

Edit 3: ok last edit haha, another big issue is definition what people think is liberal/ conservative.

Rioting and spray painting governement property, and blocking roads in protest to make a statement: is not a liberal thing, its an agressive and destructive political methode to promote any ideology, reform or to prevent reform. Even if they say it is liberal , it is not. 

While racial profiling and and using inhumane means to herd people and satisfy personal beliefs Isn't conservative, its racisism, and extremist like in behavior.  they may claim it to be conservative, but its up to you to see things for what they really are. It is in my opinion the Right started off by claiming that they are for family values. However their policies indicate that they favor the rich and wealthy.

None of their policies that they want to implement are meant to benefit the average American person.

They are against Universal Health Care or at the very least affordable health care.

They are against protecting the environment.

They prefer giving tax breaks on top of tax breaks to the rich and corporations.

They're trying to turn our form of government into a Christian theocracy.

They do not believe in civil rights.

They do not believe in equal rights.

They do not believe in women's rights. By the way, true Union card carrying member, southern Democrat. We are consiberal / libervative Because they don't proofread. I think you should participate in this discussion. What’s the point is just posting? I don't hate anyone and honestly the lefties I know all feel the same. Having said that I've stopped trying to have a reasonable conversation with righties because as a group they tend to be completely brainwashed from Fox News and foam at the mouth at the mere hint that Donald Trump isn't a demi-god. Since the rise of Newt Gingrich the GOP/right has become increasingly more reactionary, aggressive and angry. Sometime in Obama's first term they adopted an attitude that compromise equals capitulation and it's just gotten more and more poisonous ever since. The left still understands that if we can strike a bargain and get 60% of what we want, that's better than 100% of nothing. Unless or until the right decides that compromise is acceptable - that they may only get 70 or 80% of what they want in any given situation this will continue to be the cycle. FWIW in my personal life I am actually pretty conservative in many respects. I'm married, live a quite life and believe in the benefits of hard work and saving. I don't expect anyone to do anything for me and I believe in my own ability to provide for myself and my family. Where I part company - and have since the late 80's - with the GOP/right is the racism, the endless culture wars, the endless venom and the winner take all brassknuckles brawling ethos they embody. I probably would have been a Republican in the 50's but definitely not now. Do you want to fight the conservative media's lies and right wing politicians' dishonesty? Are you willing to fight them using a little bit of their own poison? Then check out  [r/Meme\_Warfare](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meme_Warfare/)! My boyfriend is a moderately conservative libertarian. We have discussions all the time. I don’t hate the right. I respond when someone says I shouldn’t be allowed to marry who I want or when someone massively fucks up the planet we all have to live on. A brief history of both, debt and deficit records for the last 37 years.  Original poster, when you have drawn your own conclusions, pm, me.","question fo liberalsI see it was removed from the other sub. Maybe that provides a little insight into why we feel like we cant communicate with the right anymore. I find it hilarious that they removed your post from /r/conservative, we're willing to discuss and they throw it out the window because it has the L word on it. It seems like a natural reaction to decades of being called traitors instead of being properly debated. You compare Obama's and Trump's rhetoric (or Bill Clinton's and W's) when discussing the other party and you'll see a huge difference. Obama made efforts to reach out to people and understand where the right was coming from. Trump is a full-blown conspiracy theorist who primarily speaks in insults.

Before that, there's also a lot of frustration because of the power imbalance between the two sides. Dems regularly get as many or more votes in Congress, but are a semi-permanent minority in the Senate because our system is based on geography instead of proportional representation. The longer you keep power away from the majority, the more the resentment builds. Growing up right, and now left, the conflict starts with a few key issues that seem to hook people into a chain of thinking. Should anyone have full access to all guns? Sould women not be allowed to abort their child? Should religious text play a bigger role in government? Are corporations more important than people? Sould businesses have the right to compensate workers as they see fit? Should workers have no right to gather, unionize, collaborate or strike? 


If you said yes to any of those questions, you're likely conservitive and don't understand why liberals would disagree. 



Liberals would look at those questions and wonder why we have to actually debate these things because Scientifically and historically these are all very bad things. 


Liberals value people and science. Government's and businesses can be remade, baseless opinions shouldn't be valid. It's why Liberals constantly want high quality care and education for the people first, so those people can work effectivity and have a good exsistance in general.



Conservitives care about the group, the leader, nationalism and religion. People don't need to be well educated or cared for. They only need to be maintained just enough to do their job and follow instructions. Using religion and the idea that they are coming to take something from you, to harm your family, to defile our worship, to change the great things we have. Suffering is a good thing, and to stop being poor you just have to work harder. I don’t like how engrained religion is with the right. I believe society is better when there’s a strong division and someone telling me what I can or can’t do with my body (example: abortion) based on gender really grinds my gears. Furthermore I find it super hypocritical that they even care in the first place cause aren’t they supposed to be all about small government? 

Also I agree with some of the other posts, hate is a strong word. Mostly I assume a republican has had a very specific life experience or they can’t read, but I don’t hate unless they’re a real asshole or a nazi (which isn’t a good look for the right either, lets be honest) Climate change is a good microcosm of left vs. right beliefs.

The Right wants to pretend it doesn't exist and is actively making it worse by rolling back all environmental protections. The center wants to do as little as possible but still work incrementally the right direction without sacrificing the comforts of status quo. The Left wants to take action before it's too late for our planet by listening to plans from the 99.9% of climate scientists from all around the globe who agree on this.

If you plan on ever having children it's not extreme to believe the American Right-wing (right wingers in other countries tend to know better) is happily going about destroying their future in the name of today's profits. I have no political affiliation. I’ve voted both sides and have registered both sides. I really hated being vilified as unamerican for not supporting w’s policies. I respect others who disagree and can form a cogent argument. Those that attack and vilify get what they ask for. I don't hate the right, I don't care for their ideas, I think for the most part, they are completely on everything.

But love our country, they're just miss informed, and gullible. I don't hate conservatives. I hate people that expect others to conform to rules that they won't conform to themselves. 

As an example, anyone that wholeheartedly believes you can discriminate against LGBT people bc it's against your own religion, and also believes it's ok to ban anyone from a different religion from this country does not deserve respect or attention. It's impossible to discuss anything in good faith with someone who selectively applies the rules. Hate is a strong word and I wouldn’t say I hate Republicans. We all have an idea of what we want our country to be. Personally I want our country to prosper with diversity while believing we are all created equal.  I have a strong intolerance of intolerant people. I find it increasingly difficult to have respect for people who want to deny others basic rights bc of their sexual orientation, immigration status or religion.  I find a majority of republicans to be religious hypocrites. They speak of God’s love yet vote for a man who spews venom and hatred.  Our government has to represent all of us equally.   We have witnessed some of the most divisive rhetoric recently.  It’s a daily occurrence to see a video or tweet of racist nonsense.  We cannot be tolerant of that and it seems at times that some republicans are willing to overlook that racism simply to have a republican in the WH. Personally I dont think there are ""Sides"" that hates the other ""side"" so much.

Liberal and conservative are very very broad terms. There are too many different opinions Grouped in up in the single words especially when there are millions of people all across the spectrum of ideology (Liberal<--------->conservative). some people have different ideologies depending on the issue at hand, probably like me you andmany others.

Its like saying you are either light skinned are dark skinned, when theres like an infinte amount of shades and tints.

People should say instead of ""I am a Liberal/conservative"" they should say ""I have a liberal/conservative opinion on that specific subject or matter""

Now with that said, to answer your question the best I can.

It's specific people who believe there are a defined Left side and defined Right side to represent a social ideology and activly voice their negative opinion of an idea they feel belongs to the other side. ""their opponent""

So I think the idea that they're are sides is a misconception. Not saying its anyones fault becuase thats just how were are delivered the information, that most people take for face value.

At the end of the day we all want the same things. Sense of security, comfort and the ability to grow unabstructed. and we are all on the same side. Unfortunatley it's become our culture where most people view those with an opposing approach to to what they feel is the most effective solution to a problem, as a direct enemy.

Those unable or unwilling to move beyond that mentality ""take sides"" so they can have support from people they think shares their interest and trust to make it easier to color the enemy in one bright color. This is'nt just politics. This is in almost everything we do here in america.

It's the easy way out compared to, taking the hours and hours it takes to set aside the ego, listen, communicate and learn to understand why an idea we think ineffective is viewed as appropriate by your fellow citizen. compromising and coming to an agreement that benifits as many many people as possible as well as is in the best interest for the purpetuality of this nation.

Edit: I could be wrong, I'm pretty uninformed when it comes to politics nowadays. I just collect bottle caps and repair consumer electronics for a living.

Glad you asked this, Id really like more people to think about this often.

Edit 2: also sometimes people just hate a specific person who claimes to be from a side and then automaticly to people they paint everyone in that group like that one person.

Edit 3: ok last edit haha, another big issue is definition what people think is liberal/ conservative.

Rioting and spray painting governement property, and blocking roads in protest to make a statement: is not a liberal thing, its an agressive and destructive political methode to promote any ideology, reform or to prevent reform. Even if they say it is liberal , it is not. 

While racial profiling and and using inhumane means to herd people and satisfy personal beliefs Isn't conservative, its racisism, and extremist like in behavior.  they may claim it to be conservative, but its up to you to see things for what they really are. It is in my opinion the Right started off by claiming that they are for family values. However their policies indicate that they favor the rich and wealthy.

None of their policies that they want to implement are meant to benefit the average American person.

They are against Universal Health Care or at the very least affordable health care.

They are against protecting the environment.

They prefer giving tax breaks on top of tax breaks to the rich and corporations.

They're trying to turn our form of government into a Christian theocracy.

They do not believe in civil rights.

They do not believe in equal rights.

They do not believe in women's rights. By the way, true Union card carrying member, southern Democrat. We are consiberal / libervative Because they don't proofread. I think you should participate in this discussion. What’s the point is just posting? I don't hate anyone and honestly the lefties I know all feel the same. Having said that I've stopped trying to have a reasonable conversation with righties because as a group they tend to be completely brainwashed from Fox News and foam at the mouth at the mere hint that Donald Trump isn't a demi-god. Since the rise of Newt Gingrich the GOP/right has become increasingly more reactionary, aggressive and angry. Sometime in Obama's first term they adopted an attitude that compromise equals capitulation and it's just gotten more and more poisonous ever since. The left still understands that if we can strike a bargain and get 60% of what we want, that's better than 100% of nothing. Unless or until the right decides that compromise is acceptable - that they may only get 70 or 80% of what they want in any given situation this will continue to be the cycle. FWIW in my personal life I am actually pretty conservative in many respects. I'm married, live a quite life and believe in the benefits of hard work and saving. I don't expect anyone to do anything for me and I believe in my own ability to provide for myself and my family.

848,"Texas Is Bracing for a Blue Wave in 2020. Yes, Texas.",Liberal,progress18,t5_2qxt5,cpax04,"Texan living in Kevin Brady’s district here. Trump has done a lot for the Democrats down here. By sheer force, his level of stupidity and corruption has turned a number of people. At the same time it has entrenched much of his base. I don’t expect my district to flip but there are a number of us fighting the good fight. Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to see Texas turn blue. It’d be historic, change the political calculus on every national race for the next twenty years, and prove that there’s no battle we should opt out of just because we assume it’s a lost cause.

But it is still extremely unlikely, and there are other fronts that need attention too. I worry that Texas is getting more buzz than it deserves, and there’s plenty of other fronts that need attention right now. If TN would only come to their senses too. I will believe it when I see it. I'll believe it when I see it. Texas is renowned for being hard-headed and set in their ways. They see an R next to a name they're gonna vote for it even if they don't particularly like it.

Texas will stay red, mark my reds...I mean, words. I’d love for Ohio to do the same thing (even though it’s always been pretty split), and I think Trump’s horrific response to the Dayton shooting could make that happen. I started voting in 2008 and even back then Texas was supposedly on the verge of going blue. I'll believe it when I see it. While it has a huge impact on the presidential election, I'd like to see one (or both) of the Senators get unseated. How's MJ Hegar doing? I fear the gerrymandering and compromised voting mechanisms may interrupt any blue waves.  I am positive any Dem candidate will win the popular vote, but there is too much corruption going on to say for sure whether the results will match the votes. They sure didn't last time. Moving back to Texas after two years in new jersey. 

I can't wait to volunteer and spread awareness in my small town about the negatives of trump. I'm definitely going to do my best to push as many people here blue as possible. 


It sucks that they are so propagated, especially old friends that I thought would be able to help, but life is a challenge. They own the voting machines and vote against voter reform.  Bet these crooks still win. ""Really? Well since it's so assured, I guess I don't have to vote in 2020!""

- a democrat in texas  Not while Russia controls the polling stations If it comes to pass the Dems better deliver. It might be a sign of how red the blue has become.

Lastly, support candidates - especially those in Congressional races that are highly competitive and have great potential to flip blue! I’ve heard this one before. Beto was such a let down. There are a lot of us fighting the good fight in Texas. Unfortunately there are still a lot, a LOT of rural (I don’t want to say it but I have to say it, uneducated) counties that will always vote republican, no matter what. However cities like Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, and their surrounding counties are staunchly blue, and I think will get more blue by 2020. I went to a PACKED Elizabeth Warren town hall at the University of Houston and met a ton of liberal activists. Everyone was cheering for her, and even the overflow room was overflowing. It was great to see, and us liberal Texans definitely exist and are growing. I don’t know if it will be enough to completely flip Texas by 2020, but given people actually come to the polls (one of the bigger issue Texas Democrats face is actually registering and showing up to vote) I think the results will surprise a lot of people. Lol it wont happen to many repukes Oh, is it election season again? 

I'll believe it when I see something blue come out of there. I used to live in Texas. We’ve been hearing this every single election cycle, at least since 2008. The closest they got was a split state legislature, while otherwise voting GOP. Most recently, they thought they had a chance at replacing one of the least popular members of the Senate.

Local and state GOP candidates are sometimes halfway sane when talking to Latina and Latino voters. Sometimes Mexican American majority districts vote GOP. I say this, because the national discourse tends to overemphasize the Latina/o - Democratic Party association when reporting on Texas. I was also told there was like a 2% chance that Trump would win the election. In the words of 43, ""fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again "".

Have you ever noticed that when trump does something wrong he immediately blames someone else, Epstein and him were very close and partied together even at mar a lago.

He's trying to blame the Clinton's that fact alone makes me think that he had something to do with his friends death.

Epstein is now conveniently dead, here is hoping that he left an open in case of death safety deposit box. Trump always projects HIS wrongdoings onto others.  So........just saying if he is true to form, case closed. I can imagine a conspiracy but think that calls between the White House and Russia were involved. Nobody should be defending Clinton, Trump or any other documented and known Epstein associate until the court case is...

...oh wait. May Bill, Donald, and everyone else who knows Epstein be thoroughly investigated and all of the guilty go to prison. This seems like a distraction. What does trump want the media not paying attention to? You said you liked the guy? The fuck? Epstein was close to both Bill and to him... Stupid thing for him to say, but that's Trump for you. Why is everybody just ignoring trump’s links to Epstein? They’re frothing at the mouth to get the clintons, and willfully forgetting Trumps links to him.

875,Opinion | Jeffrey Epstein’s apparent suicide is unfathomable,Liberal,atomicmarc,t5_2qxt5,coltjt,"The way this piece is written, it almost implies some sort of intention to the point of fomenting Epstein’s demise. 

And with the way things are going in the US, I sincerely doubt we will ever discover anything more than a patsy to accept blame.

I never thought I’d say this but I don’t believe in America anymore. It’s increasingly corrupt management (both public & private) has destroyed any good that the USA used to stand for. FBI should be checking the bank activity of every individual named in this case to see who wired the money to the prison guard on duty. maybe he slipped and fell into a noose Another exclamation point that the media pretends is a question mark.

What part of ""terrorist dictatorship"" are some folks not understanding about the Trump regime?

Epstein was a very big potential problem for him, and now he's not. I don’t usually delve into conspiracy theories and even if some of them are true I choose not to take the time to get to the bottom of them mostly because the issues may not effect my day today existence.  Did we land on the moon? Whether it’s yes or no my mortgage is still due.  

That said, I will never believe this was as simple as a suicide and that there weren’t powerful people orchestrating his death. Its really not. He wasnt on suicide watch. He offed himself to avoid hassle in prison. Sloppy job Mossad","Opinion | Jeffrey Epstein’s apparent suicide is unfathomableThe way this piece is written, it almost implies some sort of intention to the point of fomenting Epstein’s demise. 

And with the way things are going in the US, I sincerely doubt we will ever discover anything more than a patsy to accept blame.

I never thought I’d say this but I don’t believe in America anymore. It’s increasingly corrupt management (both public & private) has destroyed any good that the USA used to stand for. FBI should be checking the bank activity of every individual named in this case to see who wired the money to the prison guard on duty. maybe he slipped and fell into a noose Another exclamation point that the media pretends is a question mark.

What part of ""terrorist dictatorship"" are some folks not understanding about the Trump regime?

Epstein was a very big potential problem for him, and now he's not. I don’t usually delve into conspiracy theories and even if some of them are true I choose not to take the time to get to the bottom of them mostly because the issues may not effect my day today existence.  Did we land on the moon? Whether it’s yes or no my mortgage is still due.

Guards are trained to check up on inmates every 15 minutes in order to see what they’re doing. How does Epstein commit suicide when he has nothing in the cell? How does he hang himself when there’s nothing he can use? No shoe laces, most likely no blanket. How🧐 Glad he's dead, but this was an outcome everyone saw coming. Even if he did actually kill himself, someone was going to get him to keep him quiet sooner or later. Either he was strung up by someone else or its not his body they cut down. 
I don't think the man had the guts to kill him self News flash, conservatives are framing this across reddit as the Clinton's.

While epstein had connections with lots of the rich and powerful, don't let the world forget he has connections with Trump as well. You mean the Jeffrey Epstein who shared underage teen girls with this US President prior to being touched by God into a Christian? Too bad. I was looking forward to him rolling over on Trump. I agree with the general consensus surrounding this death. However, another great issue to address is how this was allowed to happen under the watch of prison guards? How have we, the greatest country in the West, failed to protect even the people we incarcerate? Once he realized there were no children in his prison. Good NEEEEEEWWWWWWWSSSSSS

Republican logic. Louie Gomert might be the dumbest person on the planet who doesn’t have a legal guardian to look after their affairs. When and if pastors shoot people with assault rifles for political reasons, sure. Republicans sure have mastered all of the flaws of reasoning. Is he...... planning on doing a shooting? What kind of pastors do you have, Texas?  GOHMERT! 

Just in case anyone forgot this moment from more sane times.

who preach literal GENOCIDE against the LGBTQIA+ community,

SHOULD be designated as hate group leaders,

and added to terrorist watch lists. Crazy Louie still isn't making any sense after all these years :) It is damn amazing that anyone this dumb is elected for anything. It always baffles me when I wiki these people and find that not only did they matriculate undergraduate study but they also went on to get a law degree and become a judge and then a congressman. How can someone who says such dumb shit be that successful in their professional life? Lol, so what? Good Ridiculous but if it were so, so great! It’s hard to make fun of these people at this point, they have become so common that there is no more jokes to be made about them, they write themselves to be jokes. Because they are the victims right? Good, Pastors aren't exempt from the law Sentences starting with *Texas Congressman* have a 97.5% chance of ending with something impressively stupid. Why do they always make these slippery slope arguments? What chu hiding? What Why...they inspire hate And about time. Remember when Twitter (or maybe it was Facebook?) said that they couldn't use an algorithm to automatically delete white supremacist/violent racist posts or accounts, because too many Republican politicians would get flagged and deleted?

Good times. God they use the dumbest arguments. It's exhausting."

917,Question about gun control,Liberal,ancombra,t5_2qxt5,cnqdev,"Having a goal of stopping crime is certainly a noble one but it is not possible. The reality is that we can only hope to reduce the carnage. Keeping guns out of the hands of people known to be violent could certainly help. Background checks that keep guns out of the hands of violent felons and people with restraining orders against them is a good idea. Making sure even private owners must comply with these background checks and doing away with gun show sales would help out. Get rid of gun shows and assault weapons. I don't see why anyone needs a gun at all. A lot of confusion is all around the definition of an “assault weapon”. Some people say military style, but muskets were military style at one point, but to say that’s an assault weapon that should be banned because it could be used in a mass shooting is sheer stupidity.

My definition of assault weapons is as follows:

1. Semi or fully automatic.

2. Shoulder stock or two handed grip. Two landed meaning there are two grips on the weapon. Griping your own hand in a weaver stance (or similar) is not included.

3. Effective range of more then 100 yards. (Effective defined as the weapon is design to put its whole payload within a 6x6 inch square when fired from a ransom rest)

4. A length under 44 inches from barrel tip to stock.

5. A clip of 12 or more rounds not including a round in the chamber.

6. A quick change clip or compatibility with stripper clips. (A clip is defined as a pre-loadable device to quickly bring the weapons payload to full).

7. Easily modification with an automatic conversion, or silencer. (Devices like bump stocks, which I admit I’d never heard of before the Vegas shooting should simply be banned).

I think if a firearm fits four or more of those rules, it could be considered an assault weapon. Shotguns, pistols, and hunting rifles shouldn’t be captured by such categories, or if they are, not enough of them to be an assault weapon.

Too many people that don’t own or understand guns end up saying things are assault weapons because they look kind of like an M-16 or otherwise appear scary. I own three weapons myself, a S&W model 469 9mm pistol, an 1895 Winchester lever action, and a 1943 Enfield. The enfield almost undoubtably saw combat in WW2 (1943, it’s almost a certainty), but I’d hardly call a heavy bolt action rifle with a 10 round clip an assault rifle. Early ones had a volley site to be fired like a bow and arrow for heavens sake.

Edit: clarified some of the categories. There's no one magic bill that solves all problems. 

*Should be easy:*

But I think universal background checks is a great place to start. 

More mental health funding and support, also great. 

More regulations in people with mental health issues, and their ability to own guns. 


*Harder lift:*

Assault weapons bans 

Clip size restrictions


*Almost impossible:*

Partial ban of semiautomatic  handguns and non-hunting rifles.

I'm not terribly picky and I would take just the easy ones for now. Your posting history is a laughing stock. Trolling subs left and right. 

Any intellectually honest person that wishes to have a discussion starts it with their own positions. 

You seem to be too cowardly to try that.","Question about gun controlHaving a goal of stopping crime is certainly a noble one but it is not possible.

918,The Second-Amendment Case for Gun Control,Liberal,BlueOrange,t5_2qxt5,cnonr3,"Excellent article, and great recountance of Jefferson. Revisionism has lead us down this path of the mythos of the right to bear arms, just as it has lead us down a similar path when it comes to the separation of church and state and what Jefferson meant with that as well. Funny how “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State” is totally ignored by gun supporters. It's a good article, and I'm afraid not relevant.  The concept of 'the peace', or civil peace if you will has been superseded by the implementation of a standing military, and a standing police whose official role is to keep the peace (else why call them 'peace officers').  

Personal arms in the late 1800's were for personal protections, and all members of a community *de facto* members of a militia for community protection, with the responsibility to a local authority.  And, importantly, this was a recognized part of membership in the community.  In a sense, it's kinda like a rural volunteer fire-fighting force today.  

A distinct problem comes when there is documented evidence of the standing police force being accountable only to itself, and leading to the exact kind of (perceived) tyranny that led to the American Revolution in the first place.  The dilemma is 'give up your arms and allow tyranny, or keep your arms and allow tragedy.'   If you don't believe in tyranny, you work for giving up your arms.  If you do, you work to keep them.  Neither path is acceptable. [deleted]","The Second-Amendment Case for Gun ControlExcellent article, and great recountance of Jefferson.

As for me I started voting in 68, registered independent but with very liberal views. When all of this rhetoric boils down, underneath it all is incredibly profound racism and bigotry. 
The Republican party plays to that for all its worth.  it's not going away.  I have run out of hope. Well, Bernie is not a real Democrat.  Use that line with her. I don’t. I’m just waiting for them to die off and trying to make sure we get younger voters out. OP is fighting against years or decades of right wing foxnews indoctrination. I’m curious what her Faux News intake is these days. 

As my mom aged, she started going to the local senior center. Along with a hot lunch, there was a steady stream of Faux on the TV, and a good portion of the patrons are rust-belt retirees that couldn’t afford Florida (she lives in SW Arizona), and very pro Trump. 


This was a woman that had experienced outwardly hostile racism (by being married to a black man for 10years), and now rails against BLM protesters and immigrants like they are the scum of the earth, and don’t even dare mention Hillary if you’re smart...

The change that’s taken place in the last few years is astounding. She has, for all intents and purposes, been radicalized. I’m not sure about your grandma specifically but if the democrats abandoned identity politics and actually focused on the problems facing middle and lower class Americans(of all colors and genders) they would win in a landslide.  Try to have her focus on the important issues and not the distractions. Suck trumps orange cock","How do we convince Midwest Boomers to vote for the left?Her reactions show that logic has nothing to do with her decision. There is no convincing them BC even if you do on the economics of someone like Bernie, they will happily destroy themselves financially over lip service from candidates to outlawing abortion.

948,How do conservatives still think they’re better at managing the economy?,Liberal,mouchy121,t5_2qxt5,cmyla5,"They don't ignore reality. One must understand reality to effectively propagandize a bubble distorting it. 

Conservatives are better at looting the country to increase the wealth of the privileged. They don't care that they aren't better at managing the economy because that's not the point. > Anyway, why do they actively ignore reality? 

This is the core problem with just about everything to do with conservatives.  They have failed at everything, they do nothing well and never have. Conservative president's have been in the White House for both of our nation's greatest economic catastrophes. The Great Depression (Hoover) and the Great Recession (Bush). They make the economy better *FOR THEM* they increase military spending. most of which goes to the military contractors, and soldiers do skew Republican. They start wars, which further enriches the military contractors. And  so much for the soldiers. they cut taxes for the extremely wealthy. they cut services  to the urban poor as often as they can. Then, they lie about being good for the economy to the rest of us, because they lie about everything. Because much of conservatism is about looking backward and not changing. Conserving traditions. Or at least misremembered oversimplifications of the past and what is considered traditional. Oftentimes those traditions came about through the work of progressives changing their world, but I digress.

Because that worldview is stuck in a known, yet glorified and misremembered past, conservatives don’t tend to think they can be wrong because they’re taking a safe, reliable path (in their minds). Because this way of thinking dovetails nicely with the human social tendency to distrust change, one issue often gets mistaken for the other. Conservatives are therefore more likely to double down on their errors, thinking their ideologies and policies simply haven’t been implemented enough.

The trouble is, people are constantly changing and so is the economy. That doesn’t mean that progressives get it right all the time. But progressives tend to approach situations with greater weight given toward present needs and conditions and are thus willing to learn from mistakes and course correct when things aren’t working. A recent study (couple years ago) acknowledged that the economy is better under Democrats, but couldn't pinpoint anything that the party was doing to cause this.

Didn't point out the obvious.  Democrats don't help the economy, but Republicans actively fuck it up. They’re delusional and have hallucinations they’re the bestest at everything because they make they make laws to line their own pockets with money and fuck everyone else, that's why. There's also this thing called gas lighting and public denial. >Anyway, why do they actively ignore reality?

Because the alternative would be to admit that theirs is an inept ideology. Well if you give the comparisons you gave it looks very obvious. If you look at more information ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_U.S.\_states\_and\_territories\_by\_economic\_growth\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_economic_growth_rate)) it becomes less clear what is better. You are also asking the wrong question, there is no liberal vs conservative states. California is politically quite different from Oregon, and Georgia is different from west Virginia. A better way to look at the issue at hand is: Is more government control good or bad for the economy, and when you look into the answer is, it depends on the specific economic situation. [deleted] Malignant narcissists, which are the bedrock of US ""conservatism"",  believe they're better than others at everything.  No evidence is needed, and in fact not welcome since it would subject them to some sort of objective test.  They're impenetrable to reality, and respond to *proof* that they're wrong - about anything - with violent hatred. politics are all about money ,power and control. they might not have started out this way but the corruption is DEEP. the difference there seems to be now is that Dems tend to want to share and Republicans tend to want to hoard it all for themselves. They expertly manufacture financial disasters to undermine the Democratic administration that follows. You’d be surprised how many people consider themselves fiscally conservative, because they believe those policies work You can’t grab random states and say one is better than the other fiscally. Every state has unique populations, features and geography that make help identify its economy. 

Let’s compare two similar states: California and Texas. Both very large populations, multiple major cities and both near large bodies of water. 

Texas has an unemployment rate of 3.6%, low taxes, low cost of living and corporations are banging on the door to open up shop there. 

On the flip side, California has an unemployment rate of 4.1, absurd taxation, unmanageable cost of living for a large portion of the population and companies are leaving left and right. 

How about Illinois vs Tennessee? About one major city in each, surrounded by rivers and a pretty even distribution of urban, suburban, and rural settings. 

Illinois and Tennessee have the same unemployment rate, but people are leaving Illinois and moving to places like Tennessee, citing taxes and companies moving out of state. Tennessee is growing in population, and corporations are moving in because, you guessed it, low corporate taxation. Two recurring themes in the Republican talking points are denigration of Positive progress made by Democrats combined with claiming this very same progress as their own. The Great republiCon recession of 2008 was a gift to the Cons.. The upward progression of wealth was accelerated immensely.. almost like it was planned.. I've asked my trumpanzee father why he supports the GOP in general.  He has told me for many years,""I tend to put a little more money in my pocket when Republicans are in charge...and guns"".  Neither of these things are actually true but he has been repeating this same bullshit since Reagan was President.

Of course currently he is being ostracized from our 1/2 Mexican family because it's kinda hard not being pissed at someone who values a few bucks and a 9mm over his own children, grandchildren and even his own immigrant parents. I'm hoping the next crash occurs before the '20 election.. The Conservative mindset is based purely in ideology. It's faith, like a religion, if you will. They were told that conservative policies are best by an authorities, and they will believe that no matter what the evidence says.

* Tax breaks for the wealthy stimulate the economy

* Outlawing abortion reduces unwanted pregnancy

* Private enterprise is always better/more efficient than government

And other myths they will never drop despite the evidence suggesting otherwise. They're not ignoring it, they just down care/are benefiting anyway. Basically since Reagan the rich, which the republicans represent (And many democrats, let's not kid ourselves) , wealth has grown enormously at expense of the share that the rest of us. Its time americans call bullshit on Trump and the GOP being for the common man. Word.  It's not bandied about like it used to be but I always hated ""tax and spend liberals""  Ummm...you know that's how finance works right?  I'll take a tax and spend liberal over a spend and spend conservative any day of the week. They really have no claim anymore to be a party of ""fiscal responsibility"" when their supreme leader is openly blowing up the deficit even further. Conservatives don’t give millions of dollars to minority groups just because they are minorities Texas vs California Well your matchups are invalid. Most of those states were conservative leaning at one point. Also geography plays an important part. Beach cities do better for example. They have a denser population and reside along popular trade routes. Liberals prefer to live in condensed places with lots of ammenities and more tech driven. Conservatives tend to gravitate to less condensed areas where they can have more property. Democrats also tend to cost the government more. They use a larger portion of welfare programs and they are responsible for the majority of the expensive programs the government has implemented or is trying to implement. [deleted] The economy crashes under both liberal and conservative management, because trustee both allied with the capitalist class and allow for financialization and deregulation of the economic system. The fact that liberals are elected in places like New York, the epicenter of the global housing crash, shouldn’t be a point of pride for you. Why do liberals think its ok to put hormone blockers in 3 year olds? Because we know what's it's like to work.","How do conservatives still think they’re better at managing the economy?They don't ignore reality.

 stop soft balling this we need to call it what it is when it happens. stop allowing racists to act more offended about being called racist than they are about actual racism! He’s not my favorite but I looooved him saying this. It was really from the heart. He is pissed off and saddened to shit over this. El Paso is his home town and this was as authentic as politicians get. I hope the media listened to him and looked inside. Spot on Even if I am broadly not a huge Beto-fan, I love everything about his statements on this subject. One of the things the Democratic party really struggles with is being/appearing genuine. Worse yet, our media legitimizes Trump and his ilk *every day* through their absurd refusal to call him and his followers what they are.

I hope more people take a lesson from Beto here. I know a lot of liberals love that he said this and it really fired up their base Just getting a low-life to pander for the lefties.... Yea, the rest of the dems have to pull their heads out of their ass too. What a wreckage. With each of these comments Trumps chances in 2020 increase.  It’s fun to watch the baseless outrage throwing away any chance of beating him. The dayton shooter was an Elizibeth Warren supporter. Nice way of promoting yourself, bud.","'Jesus Christ, of course he's racist,' Beto O'Rourke vehemently says of Trump, tying him to weekend shootingsWaiting for all the fake Christians to clutch their pearls because Beto said Jesus Christ while they simultaneously supporting trump’s racism. if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's a freaking DUCK.

And they'll talk about it, but they just wont pass it and will overturn anything that gets passed. I think that we need more restrictions on the more deadly weapons (like assault rifles) as well as better background checks.

Restricting access to dangerous weapons (like assault rifles) should in theory reduce the amount of damage a shooter can cause, while letting people with legitimate reasons for owning guns still have theirs (hunters could keep their hunting rifles, homeowners could keep their pistols and shotguns, etc). It would be nice if we could eliminate guns altogether from our society, but I doubt that it would be possible/beneficial right now.

Better background checks and mental instability screening would be nice because they would keep people who shouldn’t have guns from getting them, without stopping law-abiding citizens from owning them if they want.

8,Target raised its minimum wage. Now employees are complaining that their hours have been cut,Conservative,dtlv5813,t5_2qh6p,dja2jp,"> One of the reason hours are being cut is the development of retail automation, namely in the form of the self-checkout line.

> “They really cut those hours back from them with the introduction of self-checkout”,a former store director told CNN.

Retail automation is coming no matter what happens to minimum wage.

Those machines are significantly much cheaper then an employee at $10, $13, or $15 per hour on which you need insurance, admin, and payroll taxes. Ya know, Action - Reaction. Funny how that works.Funnier that the Trigglypuffs haven't figured it out. This is the key concept missing from the left.  X amount of work is worth Y amount of dollars.  If you do X in 8 hours, your pay is 8Y.  If you want to raise your pay to 130% of Y, you either do 130% more work or you do X amount of work, but in 30% fewer hours, thus restoring the balance between X and Y. Hours being cut and higher prices are the 2 ramifications of an increased minimum wage. It's not rocket science. You think they are pissed now wait until they have robots putting out merchandise and facing the shelves to align product. Well duh.

Democrats and their asinine belief in magic money gets disproved.  AGAIN. Yes we are! Gee, it's almost like when you cost more to a business, a business wants less of you. Who'd have thought businesses would try to reduce costs? I work at Target and I can say that we have noticed a drastic shift in the number of people working at any given time as peoples hours have been cut. We used to have two people at all times in electronics (the department where I work) and now we only have 1 the majority of the time. Weve had plenty of nights where other than clothing and cashiers, there are 3 people closing the entire rest of the store.

Institute 4 day work week! It's ok though, target claims it is not cutting hourse. We believe them, right?","Target raised its minimum wage. Now employees are complaining that their hours have been cut> One of the reason hours are being cut is the development of retail automation, namely in the form of the self-checkout line.

> “They really cut those hours back from them with the introduction of self-checkout”,a former store director told CNN.

Retail automation is coming no matter what happens to minimum wage.

Those machines are significantly much cheaper then an employee at $10, $13, or $15 per hour on which you need insurance, admin, and payroll taxes. Ya know, Action - Reaction. Funny how that works.Funnier that the Trigglypuffs haven't figured it out. This is the key concept missing from the left.  X amount of work is worth Y amount of dollars.  If you do X in 8 hours, your pay is 8Y.  If you want to raise your pay to 130% of Y, you either do 130% more work or you do X amount of work, but in 30% fewer hours, thus restoring the balance between X and Y. Hours being cut and higher prices are the 2 ramifications of an increased minimum wage. It's not rocket science. You think they are pissed now wait until they have robots putting out merchandise and facing the shelves to align product. Well duh.

Democrats and their asinine belief in magic money gets disproved.  AGAIN. Yes we are! Gee, it's almost like when you cost more to a business, a business wants less of you. Who'd have thought businesses would try to reduce costs? I work at Target and I can say that we have noticed a drastic shift in the number of people working at any given time as peoples hours have been cut. We used to have two people at all times in electronics (the department where I work) and now we only have 1 the majority of the time. Weve had plenty of nights where other than clothing and cashiers, there are 3 people closing the entire rest of the store. The store looks worse, is much less organized, and everyone is much more stressed. The pay is nice for low skill work but I would get paid less for a better work environment.

We agree on this ceasefire. This ceasefire is a result of the resistance of Kurds, Arabs, Syriacs and the oressure of int’l community”

 So it appears so far both sides are at the table.  Let's see how long it lasts...

 This is apparently the guy Trump referenced in his letter to Erdogan. Feels like the first time in my lifetime we *haven't* armed and supported the radical militant faction. Interesting. I'm somewhat skeptical, but I can't wait to see how this works out (and how it will be spun to bash the evil Orange Man). Are you suggesting that it’s possible to promote some peace in the Middle East without being in a perpetual war for all of eternity? I don’t believe it Very happy to see this. Hopefully it becomes a longer-lasting peace. 

The letter was weird (funny, though) but whatever gets the job done I guess. 

Trump is probably not happy about conceding to allowing troops to stay and guard the ISIS prisoners, but all the old warmongers, and their new, magically war loving dem partners were having cows. And typically the basement dwellers of Reddit are using gold medal mental gymnastics to explain how this is bad news.  Jesus it must be awful to live life like that.
Edit. Words A 120 hour ceasefire that will allow Kurdish forces to retreat. I guess we will see how this works out. Good. Get our allies out of there. And North Korea agreed to stop building certain things 

And then went right back to building them. 

Will this be legitimate? Considering what Turkey did after the last negotiation (to remove Kurd defenses), I'm a little concerned about this.

I doubt that Turkey will go along with a permanent ceasefire.  This is likely just be a ploy to gain easy ground and dismantle remaining Kurd defenses in the area. Extremely relieving news. I still worry that we’re acquiescing too much influence in the region to hostile actors (Assad, Iran, Russia), but this was the best outcome of a bad situation. So the YPG has to make the first move, and the Turks are expected to play along in good faith. In 120 hours the Kurds have to evacuate from the buffer zone, and then hold their breath to see whether Turkey returns to their own side or takes this as free real estate. 

Sounds far from over to me. Well they cleaned up the mess they created last week....good on them?

Despite polls showing an increase in public support for impeachment removing the president is still only popular among those who already opposed the president.  Why might House Democrats never actually vote to impeach President Trump. House Democrats don't think they have sufficient political support in the country for impeachment.  Impeachment not only risks invigorating President Trump’s base but also most independent voters seem to have little appetite for impeachment.  A vote on impeachment will also leave Democrats in purple seats vulnerable, risking the same seats that delivered the House of Representatives to Democrats control in the 2018 midterms.  A vote on impeachment will also pass the torch to the Senate, ending the Democrat’s (and Pelosi's) control over the impeachment process.  This would be a major loss for Democrat’s because ever since they gained control of the House they have been able to complicate President Trump's agenda with talk of impeachment any time they want, as soon as a vote is held, they loose that power.  Senate Republicans and President Trump will use the Senate trial (and subsequent acquittal) as proof the Democrats have been engaged in a deranged witch-hunt since they lost the 2016 election.  What can the House Democrats say during President Trump's inevitable victory laps.  They knew it would happen? They knew that it was inevitable with a GOP majority in the Senate?   Then why did they engage in such a divisive and destructive procedure to begin with?  It is likely that the build up to impeachment is much more politically valuable to Democrats than impeachment itself.  The political pros of formally impeaching President Trump are far outweighed by the huge list of cons.  The moment House Democrats actually vote to impeach they become irrelevant.  It seems that Nancy Pelosi knows this as she has been trying to put the breaks on her far-left caucus since the moment she regained the speaker ship. I feel like a lot of us know this is mostly political theater put on by the democrats to incite their base. Pelosi was pushed into this by the younger dems. She knows how to play the game and this is not it. I won't.

I wasn't actually trolling, tbh, when I asked the person to explain. I'll try to go back and find the thread and share it, though that might be bridaging? Dunno. I'll take my chances since I have flair. 

Anyway, this article is interesting and so here's my thought on it. 

Yes, a company like Blizzard, which is being torn apart right now by weebs, SJWs, and lots of other people on the internet, all for good reason, can censor your comment. 

But just because Blizzard, or any privately owned company, can censor you, doesn't mean everybody else should be calling for censorship. 

Maybe I'm wrong here but, individuals cannot censor you. And when somebody who makes a dumb mistake or is actually trolling on the internet, calling for their censorship is dangerous because then you obviously have nothing but an infinite echo chamber. And if you can turn an entire app, or section of the internet into your very own sandbox, things get ugly outside of that when the same tactics are used elsewhere. 

Just look at Antifa as an example. Or 8chan.

People were telling me this exact idea, that the First Amendment only applies to being protected from the government. 

I wasn't actually trolling, tbh, when I asked the person to explain. I'll try to go back and find the thread and share it, though that might be bridaging? Dunno. I'll take my chances since I have flair. 

Anyway, this article is interesting and so here's my thought on it. 

Yes, a company like Blizzard, which is being torn apart right now by weebs, SJWs, and lots of other people on the internet, all for good reason, can censor your comment.

It is a fixed pie view. In the fixed pie, you only become a millionaire by taking money from other people. You grab all of the pizza for yourself and everyone else starves.

The thing is our economy is not a fixed pie, and it grows. Millionaires in this nation by about a 2/3rd majority are self made. Most do not get there via inheritance. They make something people want and are willing voluntarily surrender dollars for. 

Even better they create job opportunities which give livelihoods to others.

Another really weird thing is present retirement planning aims at amassing over $1M over your life for your retirement. Someone who works 30-40yrs with a 401K will likely hit that point, and we are going to vilify them, for a lifetime of hard work and savings just because they have $1M? No.

These millionaires are something we should strive to become on our own, for our own well being, and the betterment of society as a whole. We should strive to become economically independent and not a burden in retirement. These are good things.

Problem is, on something like Hong Kong, if your very public career crosses paths with the issue, you’re going to be forced to take a stance. That’s just life. You don’t always get to decide which political problems you’re involved in. And by essentially saying “whatever”, he’s taken the very clear stance - whether he likes it or not - that he’s more concerned about his paycheque than he is about people’s struggle against a communist dictatorship.

Same with Blizzard. You don’t just get to push insufferable wokeness for 364 days per year, then pretend that you’re punishing players for ‘all’ political statements and not just targeting very specific political statements because it affects your business interests.

Stick to that,,, you are great at it.
There is always broadcasting after that. #LEBRON IS ASSHOLE I agree with both. We aren’t responsible for the entire world. So I agree that not every problem is our problem. He’s not a politician. Treat him as such. He can speak when he wants to speak. Understanding that if he says the wrong thing, the NBA loses a ton of money so I’m sure he was told to say exactly what he said. People saying he's right, here's the problem with that: LeBron posted the MLK quote just last year. He acts like he's some woke crusader for the downtrodden but then becomes some meek drone when standing up for something would mean he could lose money. You aren't some 'hero' when you only stand up for things that can't affect you personally, while expecting to be seen as a champion for all disaffected people. That just makes you a fraud and an asshole, and he's been exposed as most definitely a fraud. MLK cared about his brothers and sisters.

Lebron cares about Lebron. Yep, this is the hypocrisy I hate with famous people spouting political opinions.

LeBron wants to talk about BLM and anti-cop shit and when the owners of the league say ""hey man, you're going to cost us all money"" the response is ""don't tell me what to do you don't own me!""

Darryl Morey makes a comment about international events and LeBron calls him ignorant and misinformed, then declines to give an opinion - because, of course, money.

Shut up and dribble. What a fucking clown show. If you're going to have principles I'm all for it, but this was disgraceful. MLK LITERALLY explained the US purpose in getting involved in Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East. Both statements are true and do not contradict each other lol Is it wrong that I agree with Lebron here?  MLK might think different if he saw the internet and all the SJW's throwing themselves into every fight. Funny how mad everyone got at Lebron. That's what happens when you expect doofy basketball players to be role models. i loathe lebron, but his quote is actually more in line with my thinking. Martin Luther King was a dyed wool leftist. China isn't our country so I don't care what they do. He ain’t wrong. MLK's quote is just absurd. If someone down the road from me murders their partner, it's not my concern directly. It may be concerning to me if the courts let them off lightly. Gotta be honest, I agree with lebron.  This is the ideology that overvalues the problems of Central American immigrants simply because they're closer than the starving children in Africa.  You can't solve  the world's problems.  The vast majority of the worlds history has been plagued with tyranny and oppression.  Unless you're suggesting retaliation against China, it's hard for anyone over here to have a meaningful impact.

78,Viral liberal hoax claims Chick-fil-A backed a law to execute gay people,Conservative,Veritas-VosLiberabit,t5_2qh6p,dj6iz4,"Silly leftists, Chick-fil-A is Christian, not Islamic! It's almost like leftists dont' give a shit if something is true or not. If this makes lefties stop eati g there, I'm for it. That cuts the line in half for the rest of us. Wow, Snopes. That's a new low. I wouldn't exactly call it a hoax. What liberals are trying to do is take a series of connections, some stronger than others, and exaggerate it into an evil conspiracy to kill gay people.

Here's essentially the way they're doing it:

1. In 2010, Truett Cathy's Winshape Foundation gave a thousand bucks to the Family Research Council and a quarter million to the National Christian Foundation. The NCF is a huge foundation that gave 2.5 billion dollars to over ten thousand different organizations between 2009 and 2013.

2. In 2010, the NCF (going by liberals' [own sources](https://twocare.org/the-national-christian-foundation-anti-lgbt-funding-encyclopedia/)) gave money to an organization called 'TheCall', which hosted prayer meetings led by a guy named Lou Engle. That donation? ... 300 dollars.

3. This Lou Engle guy is the nameless 'minister' you see cited in all these stories. The tweet in the article frames it as if the NCF 'paid' this guy to go to Uganda specifically for this bill, but his organization is just one of many that got money through the NCF and they didn't get much that year - they did get 160 grand in 2008 when they were pushing Prop 8 in California but were being funded nowhere close since then. So while they got three hundred bucks out of them that year, I highly doubt it completely funded this guy to go to Uganda.

4. So anyway, he goes to Uganda to hold one of his prayer meetings. A week beforehand, he puts out a statement condemning the more severe parts of the anti-gay bill and says his ministry couldn't support it. He gets there and [holds the meeting though](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/world/africa/03uganda.html?emc=tnt&tntemail1=y) and he gives conflicting answers on supporting what Uganda is doing. A few of the Ugandan officials responsible for pushing the bill are also at the meeting.

5. So the US congress starts drafting a resolution to condemn the Uganda bill. The Family Research Council (that got 1,000 bucks from Winshape in 2010) spends 25 grand to 'lobby' the resolution. According to the FRC, [they didn't oppose the resolution](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/family-research-council-lobbied-congress-on-resolution-denouncing-ugandan-anti-gay-bill/) but they opposed language in the resolution that condemned religious counseling for homosexuals.

So I'd say that's a pretty fair representation of the liberal claim on the matter. Chick-fil-a donates a bunch of money to the NCF and not so much to the FRC. Of the 17,000 organizations the NCF funds, 300 dollars goes to this Lou Engle guy's 'TheCall' org. Lou Engle goes to Uganda to host a prayer meeting after saying he condemns the bad parts of the anti-gay bill, sorta still supports the bill's 'cause' when he gets there anyway, a few outright supporters of the bill are at this meeting. FRC later lobbies congress to change some language in a resolution against the bill.

I think this Lou Engle guy is pretty sketchy but he got barely any money from the NCF that year so the Chick-fil-A Ugandan kill the gays bill connection seems pretty weak to me. The worst part is people months from now will still believe the hoax, even after it was refuted here. It’s insane that the LGBTs only fight left us with a chicken restaurant,  they have been giving everything they were rightfully deserved. I know a Lefty who honestly believed that they executed gay people. 

I haven’t talked to him in a while, so I don’t know if he still believes it or not, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he still does. Nice, thanks for telling me where to eat dinner tonight. Any liberal who believed this is an idiot.","Viral liberal hoax claims Chick-fil-A backed a law to execute gay peopleSilly leftists, Chick-fil-A is Christian, not Islamic!

83,"After Michigan Governor Nixes $1.47 Million For Autism, Republican John James Donates Campaign Funds",Conservative,DH5650,t5_2qh6p,dj6071,"Next Senator for Michigan! Alright, I don't like Gretchen Whitmore, but there is a lot more going on here that isn't in the article. Here's something to understand about Michigan, we have a state run system in which Medicare payments are administered for mental health, this includes autism. Michigan has one of the best, if not the best mental health care and facilities in the country, these organizations are public sector running an administrative over head around 6 to 7 % which is amazing compared to anyone else including for profit private. 

Private insurance companies want the Medicare money, so for years now they've been trying to enter the market by any means necessary even illegal or down right unethical. This line item veto was just that. Attached that appropriation was phrasing that would allow private sector insurance to essentially kill off the public sector at will. This wouldn't normally be a problem if the private sector option was better, but it abysmally isn't. Because they've tried for so long, the previous governor gave them a deal where they maybe 5 years to prove that private was better and more cost effective. IT WASN'T over head was above 15% the care went down, and waiting went up. So in other words the tax payer dollars that are allocated to help out the mentally ill were going to be used less effectively and the insurance companies where just going to suck it like a teet while the public sector option was running smooth and perfect as could be.

And fundamentally cost more tax payer dollars and listen the great mental health care Michigan provides to its residents via Medicare. I like James a lot, but he shouldn’t be using campaign money to donate to charity.  If he wants to donate he should use his own money.","After Michigan Governor Nixes $1.47 Million For Autism, Republican John James Donates Campaign FundsNext Senator for Michigan! Alright, I don't like Gretchen Whitmore, but there is a lot more going on here that isn't in the article. Here's something to understand about Michigan, we have a state run system in which Medicare payments are administered for mental health, this includes autism. Michigan has one of the best, if not the best mental health care and facilities in the country, these organizations are public sector running an administrative over head around 6 to 7 % which is amazing compared to anyone else including for profit private. 

Private insurance companies want the Medicare money, so for years now they've been trying to enter the market by any means necessary even illegal or down right unethical. This line item veto was just that. Attached that appropriation was phrasing that would allow private sector insurance to essentially kill off the public sector at will. This wouldn't normally be a problem if the private sector option was better, but it abysmally isn't. Because they've tried for so long, the previous governor gave them a deal where they maybe 5 years to prove that private was better and more cost effective. IT WASN'T over head was above 15% the care went down, and waiting went up. So in other words the tax payer dollars that are allocated to help out the mentally ill were going to be used less effectively and the insurance companies where just going to suck it like a teet while the public sector option was running smooth and perfect as could be.

112,"Elizabeth Warren Tried Scrubbing Her DNA Video From Internet, But You Can Watch It Here",Conservative,Foubar,t5_2qh6p,dj58uf,"I guarantee you that if she ever makes it into the White House, she'll appoint at least one Native American to her cabinet. Fascinating that despite taking a lot of heat in the recent DNC debate, no one will use this against her. How weak does the DNC field have to be for her to be leading?  

A woman with no legislative achievements, who lied on her resume to get jobs, who took jobs as a person of color, all to become a multi-millionaire in the process.

She's a fake and a fraud.

Edit: Thank you kind redditor! Gawd, they are so white.  They are whiter than 99% of white people. She really shouldn't have gone all in on that DNA test. Pretty stupid if you ask me even stupider that she posted the result. 

After she got the result she should have said eh maybe i shouldn't post this or at least someone close to her should have said that. Bad move. She falsely represented herself as Cherokee. I think she has the same DNA percentage for Native American as she does for Neanderthal. She was cited as a minority hire based upon her false representation. Does cultural appropriation apply to minority status hires? Is it paleface privilege?

She falsely represented herself as being fired for being visibly pregnant, as her own interviews from years before said it was a personal decision. It seems like she needs some kind of victim level street cred, and she just doesn't have it, so she invents it as needed.

She dodged in the debate the real costs of her government largesse programs. Even Bernie stood out as an honest broker compared to her.

So here we have a liar, similar to the liar from 2016, moving into position to take the lead in the primaries. Wonder how that one will turn out. Damn that's like one hair native American Elizabeth ""Cringe-ahontas"" Warren is the best candidate the DNC can put forward in 2020, and she has no chance of defeating Trump unless Trump is successfully impeached or resigns from office. Stop being mean about her - or she'll tell her father Running Bear about you! Hey, that's my favorite movie you witch! ARE YOU SO HEARTLESS YOU WON'T ALLOW COMEDY IF ELECTED QUEEN???? 😭 how are you "" 1/1024th Native American""?

does it go 10 generations back?

a default generation is approximately 32 years, 

so did they test her (10 x 32) 320 years back to 1699 ? Are you trying to tell me she gave us the video and then took it back?

What's that called? When caught in a lie, double down on that lie. Then when all hope is lost of anyone believing said lie, sweep it under the rug(""scrub it"") and pretend it never happened.
CNN does this in the regular.. They might teach this at the Universities where Conservatives are not welcome. As a Brit who tries his best to keep up with this, this Elizabeth Warren Native American stuff has gone under my radar.  Can somebody briefly summarise it for me? It's a good laugh, but does it really matter? It's 2019. Anyone who doesn't understand the Streisand effect is unfit for office. Watching that video, and thinking to myself "".....except.....she's not native American""

Fucking liar. How is this a new post from 3 hours ago with 600 likes? It literally just appeared for me lol Give it a week and when you're arguing with FB peeps they'll say they'd *never* heard of it at all...... That was so silly of her to get baited into that. It was clear to everyone not completely overtaken with Trump Derangement Syndrome that she is whiter than toast - not that that should have mattered in the first place, but it seems that she used it to gain advantage for her self. I wonder how many of those people actually believe their own nonsense. I thought that they are just cynical, but some actually seem delusional and believe their own nonsense. I guess one could say, there's still 1/164 videos out there. Anybody know if she plans to raise taxes on the middle income folks? I guess she doesn't know what happened with Beyonce... https://youtu.be/Z6E98ZRaU1s

This is Warren's theme song. She wants that DNC primary uplift.  She's probably going to upgrade her race to 95% black.

She got away with it last time. This won't matter to Democrats unfortunately. That's why I'm so glad Trump called her out for her bullshit and said during one of his rallies he's more Native American than her! I wish I can remember exactly like he said it because it was funny af. Did you guys watch the same video as me? How was that bad? And Trump paid off porn stars.....apples to oranges. Hypocritical idiots Why does everyone keep bringing this up? I know she totally lied about her heritage and she was publicly shamed for it. That’s established. Like the whole “collusion” ordeal. It was disproved, legally. Why can’t EVERYONE just let the silly shit like this go and focus on more important things? I guarantee you that if a republican ever gets back to the white house, we'll be the next state of communist Russia. Andrew Yang is the best candidate to lead us into the future of our economy.

Edit: you downvote me now but i highly encourage you all to read his policies. yang2020.com","Elizabeth Warren Tried Scrubbing Her DNA Video From Internet, But You Can Watch It HereI guarantee you that if she ever makes it into the White House, she'll appoint at least one Native American to her cabinet. Fascinating that despite taking a lot of heat in the recent DNC debate, no one will use this against her. How weak does the DNC field have to be for her to be leading?  

A woman with no legislative achievements, who lied on her resume to get jobs, who took jobs as a person of color, all to become a multi-millionaire in the process.

She's a fake and a fraud.

Edit: Thank you kind redditor! Gawd, they are so white.  They are whiter than 99% of white people. She really shouldn't have gone all in on that DNA test. Pretty stupid if you ask me even stupider that she posted the result. 

After she got the result she should have said eh maybe i shouldn't post this or at least someone close to her should have said that. Bad move. She falsely represented herself as Cherokee. I think she has the same DNA percentage for Native American as she does for Neanderthal. She was cited as a minority hire based upon her false representation. Does cultural appropriation apply to minority status hires? Is it paleface privilege?

She falsely represented herself as being fired for being visibly pregnant, as her own interviews from years before said it was a personal decision. It seems like she needs some kind of victim level street cred, and she just doesn't have it, so she invents it as needed.

She dodged in the debate the real costs of her government largesse programs. Even Bernie stood out as an honest broker compared to her.

So here we have a liar, similar to the liar from 2016, moving into position to take the lead in the primaries. Wonder how that one will turn out. Damn that's like one hair native American Elizabeth ""Cringe-ahontas"" Warren is the best candidate the DNC can put forward in 2020, and she has no chance of defeating Trump unless Trump is successfully impeached or resigns from office. Stop being mean about her - or she'll tell her father Running Bear about you! Hey, that's my favorite movie you witch! ARE YOU SO HEARTLESS YOU WON'T ALLOW COMEDY IF ELECTED QUEEN???? 😭 how are you "" 1/1024th Native American""?

does it go 10 generations back?

a default generation is approximately 32 years, 

so did they test her (10 x 32) 320 years back to 1699 ? Are you trying to tell me she gave us the video and then took it back?

What's that called? When caught in a lie, double down on that lie. Then when all hope is lost of anyone believing said lie, sweep it under the rug(""scrub it"") and pretend it never happened.
CNN does this in the regular.. They might teach this at the Universities where Conservatives are not welcome. As a Brit who tries his best to keep up with this, this Elizabeth Warren Native American stuff has gone under my radar.  Can somebody briefly summarise it for me? It's a good laugh, but does it really matter? It's 2019. Anyone who doesn't understand the Streisand effect is unfit for office. Watching that video, and thinking to myself "".....except.....she's not native American""

Fucking liar. How is this a new post from 3 hours ago with 600 likes? It literally just appeared for me lol Give it a week and when you're arguing with FB peeps they'll say they'd *never* heard of it at all...... That was so silly of her to get baited into that. It was clear to everyone not completely overtaken with Trump Derangement Syndrome that she is whiter than toast - not that that should have mattered in the first place, but it seems that she used it to gain advantage for her self. I wonder how many of those people actually believe their own nonsense. I thought that they are just cynical, but some actually seem delusional and believe their own nonsense. I guess one could say, there's still 1/164 videos out there. Anybody know if she plans to raise taxes on the middle income folks? I guess she doesn't know what happened with Beyonce... https://youtu.be/Z6E98ZRaU1s

This is Warren's theme song. She wants that DNC primary uplift.  She's probably going to upgrade her race to 95% black.

She got away with it last time. This won't matter to Democrats unfortunately. That's why I'm so glad Trump called her out for her bullshit and said during one of his rallies he's more Native American than her! I wish I can remember exactly like he said it because it was funny af. Did you guys watch the same video as me? How was that bad? And Trump paid off porn stars.....apples to oranges.

The Democrats are completely clueless, and really have no idea what the working class needs.

Right now I think it is a good time to let our friends overseas stand on their own and deal with their problems internally rather than depend on the USA for eternal support financially and militarily.

""We aren't world police"". 

That's a cool bumper sticker, but China doesn't give a fuck about our virtue signaling here. They get off on the idea of a world with a smaller U.S. military presence. 

There are a couple of reasons you want a strong U.S. presence such as maintaining international trade routes (that benefit many countries) and maintaining promises to our allies. 

You know what happens when you don't keep your promises? Arms races. You know why they arms race? Because they are now fucking terrified of the instability which leads to more conflict. Japan and Europe will probably increase their military presence because they fear a smaller U.S. presence. 

You know the number one reason you want a strong U.S. military presence throughout world? 

Someone else will, and the options are not pretty right now. You may not like war, but war may find our friends and us.

123,Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings dead,Conservative,ChunkyArsenio,t5_2qh6p,dj4pnm,"Hard to believe he was only 68. He looked much older, plus it seems like he has been around forever. RIP May he finally find peace. Rest In Peace brother. We may not have agreed on everything. But I respected your calm nature. RIP. How sad. That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear it. I wasn't the biggest fan, but he did a ton for Baltimore's black community. >  **Article:**

Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, a longtime congressman and leader in the Democratic caucus who led multiple investigations into President Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has died.

Mr. Cummings died early Thursday at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, due to complications from longstanding health challenges, according to a statement from his office. He was 68.

In service in Congress since 1996, Mr. Cummings was a well-respected leader in the Democratic caucus who new members often looked to for guidance. He was a powerful orator, who could quell dissent in his committee hearings or unify Democrats.

He was born to a family of Southern sharecroppers, and grew up in racially divided Baltimore. He advocated for the poor in his majority-black district, which includes just over half of the city of Baltimore and most of the affluent Howard County.

At the time of his death, Mr. Cummings was embroiled in conflict with Mr. Trump, who in response to the investigations led by the Oversight committee called Baltimore a “rodent-infested mess” where “no human being would want to live.”

Mr. Cummings replied that government officials must stop making “hateful, incendiary comments” that serve only to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.

“Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,” he said in a speech at the National Press Club.

Mr. Cummings’s long career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP.

He continued his rise in Congress. In 2016, he was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee, which he said was “nothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton’s campaign” for president.

He was an early supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential bid in 2008.

Throughout his career, Mr. Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.

Elijah E. Cummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told him he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer.

That steeled Mr. Cummings to prove that counselor wrong. He became not only a lawyer but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become House speaker pro tempore, the first black delegate to hold the position. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.

Mr. Cummings was quick to note the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats.

“After coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it’s clear that the lines are drawn here,” he said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996.

Mr. Cummings was chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.

He cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected. Rip Rats! Nancy? Chuck? Maxine? RBG? [removed]","Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings deadHard to believe he was only 68. He looked much older, plus it seems like he has been around forever. RIP May he finally find peace. Rest In Peace brother. We may not have agreed on everything. But I respected your calm nature. RIP. How sad. That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear it. I wasn't the biggest fan, but he did a ton for Baltimore's black community. >  **Article:**

Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, a longtime congressman and leader in the Democratic caucus who led multiple investigations into President Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has died.

Mr. Cummings died early Thursday at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, due to complications from longstanding health challenges, according to a statement from his office. He was 68.

In service in Congress since 1996, Mr. Cummings was a well-respected leader in the Democratic caucus who new members often looked to for guidance. He was a powerful orator, who could quell dissent in his committee hearings or unify Democrats.

He was born to a family of Southern sharecroppers, and grew up in racially divided Baltimore. He advocated for the poor in his majority-black district, which includes just over half of the city of Baltimore and most of the affluent Howard County.

At the time of his death, Mr. Cummings was embroiled in conflict with Mr. Trump, who in response to the investigations led by the Oversight committee called Baltimore a “rodent-infested mess” where “no human being would want to live.”

Mr. Cummings replied that government officials must stop making “hateful, incendiary comments” that serve only to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.

“Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,” he said in a speech at the National Press Club.

Mr. Cummings’s long career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP.

He continued his rise in Congress. In 2016, he was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee, which he said was “nothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton’s campaign” for president.

He was an early supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential bid in 2008.

Throughout his career, Mr. Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.

136,Rep. Elijah Cummings dead at age 68,Conservative,Otto-Carpenter,t5_2qh6p,dj47yn,"Just like when Bernie Sanders had his heart attack, we're not celebrating this.  Let me repeat this:

**We are not celebrating the death of Elijah Cummings**.  

We conservatives make a point of separating the man from the policy.  Cummings's death is a sad time for this family and friends, and no one is going to gain from this.  His district may hold a by-election to fill his seat, but otherwise, nothing changes.

If you try to celebrate his death or say nasty things, your comment will be blocks and further consequences may result.  He will be judged in a historical context, but that cannot accurately happen while his body is above ground.  Let the dead be mourned and we will move on with our lives. That came out of nowhere. RIP. Hope his family is doing alright. RIP Congressman. The “thing” about politics is, it’s often difficult to separate the person from their ideology. That’s the nature of the beast. Whatever Cummings’ policy differences were, they are no longer of importance, save for historical context.

We are all flawed, but most people try to live productively. No doubt Elijah Cummings tried as well, in the rarified atmosphere that is politics. Best wishes to his family. I disagree with him politically on every level, but I know he commanded tremendous respect from some many conservative leaders.

Here's hoping his family can get through these tough times. 68 seems so young especially when I'm now 54. He had major health issues over the last years. 

I disagree with him on politics but I always thought that he genuinely wanted to help and get the best for his district which is always a great common point. I'm not sure I can say that about many of our congressmen and women. I didn't agree with him on much if anything in politics but I hope he found peace and his family are able to grieve without partisanship getting involved. A sad day for the House and for his family for sure. May those who knew and loved him find comfort in the challenging days ahead Rest In Peace I thought this was fake at first...really seems like it came out of left field. RIP. RIP. When one of the Koch brothers died, /r/Politics and /r/News celebrated his death. They even said ""rest in peace asshole"" and all kinds of vitriolic shit....but we're better than that. 

I may have disagreed with Rep. Cummings on policy; but he was a public servant and for that he deserves respect for his service to the country and to his constituents -- regardless of the job he did. He'll be missed, and my thoughts go out to his family in this time. With his age, it would be like losing my father, and I can't imagine that. I have plenty of political and ideological difference with the man but the Civil rights work he did early in his career was commendable. Rest In Peace Rep. Cummings. Sad you won’t get to see Trump win in 2020. Very sad, may he Rest In Peace. that is pretty young.  At least Baltimore has a shot at someone who will actually do something for them. Shame to lose an active congressman or woman Head of a committee too. Condolences to his family Rest in Peace, Representative. Rest in Peace. Sad news today.  May his family find comfort. Lots of kind comments about a political opponent here.  

I just wonder what Arrrr/Politics would be saying if it were a conservative statesman.  I doubt there would be much class or kindness. May not have agreed with him, but he did provide the American people with a service and that is commendable. I just hope either side doesn't try to politicize this. I would think they would be above profiting off a death, but sadly both sides have at times. “Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear,  using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,” Cummings said in a speech at the National Press Club. 

No irony or lack of self-awareness there. I did not agree with his politics, but I hope that he is at rest and that his family will find peace in this time of tragedy. Poor guy. RIP. Thank you for your service. It's always sad to see someone die. Rest in peace Rep. 68 is way to young to die. The guy was a civil rights giant. My condolences!

I'm choosing to remember him by his proudest accomplishments, not his weakest moments. I hope we can all do the same for the next week or so Didn't care for him, but would never wish death or harm upon him. He still served this country, so for that I thank him for his service. Hoping for the best for his family and those who were close. My condolences to his family. RIP May he rest in peace. Rip. Wow this was surprising. Pretty sad. I offer my sincere condolences. RIP. Hopefully, his district will elect someone who will give them the opportunity to improve and prosper, to stand on their own legs. I have watched several hearings over the past year and one thing that stood out to me is how well Rep. Cummings ran the room. He wasn’t perfect and there were one or two time I thought he could have done better, but for the amount of division in that room and political point scoring this man did a great job in managing the chaos. He was a great leader and I will miss seeing him in hearings, I wish the best for his family and district in this hard time. As I said in another thread, this is terrible news. Prayers for him and his family. Mark Meadows, whom I have a lot of respect for, says despite their differences Cummings was a decent guy. 68 is far too young. Though I staunchly disagree with his politics, I thank him for being dedicated to and fighting for what he believed in.  Best wishes to his family as they mourn his departure. I disagreed with his policies but he was a great politician. Sad to him go. RIP. Condolences to his family. I was not a fan of the man, or his politics, but I hope his family is doing as well as they can with this loss of a loved one, and that he finds peace, and so do they. F F Rest in Peace, this kind of came out of nowhere and unexpected. 68 isn't really that old. RIP to a long serving rep Damn he was one of few politicians who I believe was in office 100% to help other people.  Regardless of if you agree with his policies or not we lost a good man today. Thoughts and prayers for his family, however unwelcome our sentiments may be. May God rest his soul. Eternal rest grant onto him O Lord. This is legit sad. I hope his family is doing well to get through this. RIP - 68 is way too young   :( I said this about Bernie Sanders and I will say it again, while I disagreed strongly with this man I will say rest in peace. RIP congressman. My condolences to his family, hope they are dealing with this well. RIP This is so shocking. Praying for his family. Politics aside, RIP Congresssman. Rest In Peace Rest in peace. I thought he was at least 15 years older than stated age. I hope his family and friends are doing well, pray for the best for them RIP and condolences to the family. Anybody who celebrates the death of somebody who has a different political ideology is misguided, to say the least. The person's death does not eliminate that ideology. I'm sad to see that he passed away. Didn't agree with his politics, but my condolences to his family. Sad days. Definitely not what I expected to wake up to this morning 

In a way, I kinda liked Cummings.  He was old school, to say the least.  RIP. 105 positive messages  in this thread.  Just incredible.   Makes me happy. He was everything that is wrong with politics but I do hope he rests in peace. Do you think Justice Democrats will put an AOC candidate in for his seat? Wonder when the special election will take place. Folks, I felt that had to unjoin this sub a while back because it seemed like the noble and courageous parts of traditional American (and conservative) values were being ditched in favor of pettiness, meanspiritedness, and a willingness to abandon principles when they clashed with team fealty. I randomly checked back in just now, and holy cow are things different! At least based on this thread and the few others I've dug into, the sub is way more representative of decency and actual conservatism than it had been getting like 9 months ago. What happened? What made him go tits up? He was truly a man who did what he thought was right for his country, and he will be missed by many. RIP. Rest in peace. May his family find comfort. Praying for them.

PS: This is why I like this sub. We do not celebrate deaths of those who disagree with us. Instead we wish their families well and pray for them in their time of need - and if you do not, there's no place for you here. It says a lot about conservatives versus leftists, in my opinion. His gerrymandered district consisted of tax paying conservatives of northern Baltimore County who he never even acknowledged and welfare recipients/criminals of Baltimore City whom he did nothing for. He defended the Obama administration in a completely partisan way and attacked Trump with the same one sided  bias. As for his “service” Cummings used his position to enrich himself just like every other politician. Not sure why all the accolades keep pouring in. That being said 68 is way too young. As the president said, he was a very powerful voice in Congress. A good man, with good intentions. This really highlights how much black men have a lower life expectancy in the U.S.  than every other race and gender. Passed away at 68 and yet somehow RBG is still soldiering along at like 90 billion years old. 

And you know they both got top notch medical care. 

I know the gap is closing between black men and white men, but it still lags WAY behind women. I cannot imagine being gone from this world at 68, the man never even got to enjoy a retirement from the terrible job he hax every day of going to work and dealing with politicians.

And you know they both got top notch medical care. 

I know the gap is closing between black men and white men, but it still lags WAY behind women. I cannot imagine being gone from this world at 68, the man never even got to enjoy a retirement from the terrible job he hax every day of going to work and dealing with politicians.

Prayers for both him as well as his family and friends in their time of grief. Very to sorry to hear he has passed. I worked closely with him for almost twenty years. He was as tough as they come, and regardless of politics, he always did his best for his district. My heart always beat a little faster when I was testifying before his subcommittee (before he was Chair of Government and Oversight, he was Chair of the Coast Guard subcommittee) and even though the questions were usually friendly, he had a way of staring you down that made you double check your answers.  

I expect everybody here will be hating on him because of Trump, but I, for one, think Congress is better and our politics are better when we've got opponents we can respect. So governor Hogan gets to fill his seat until the next election, correct? When's the election? 68 - seems young.  Is he mad he had no choice?","Rep.

Am I reading it right that he is attaching, with his letter to Erdogan, a letter from the Kurdish general to Trump? Did the Kurdish general *want* the leader of the country attacking him to have that letter? What in the flying Hell? [removed] What..  
  
Edit: Just to flesh out what I'm thinking, my first instinct is that this is one if those Trump moments that don't really have a justification or a light side. I've been proven wrong on this sentiment pretty much any other time it's popped up (and God do I hope to be proven wrong again), but I really don't see how this is going to turn into some trap or bait that Trump manages to turn around.  
  
It doesnt change the fact that I still support pulling out of Syria, and it doesn't change 2020 for me in the slightest as this isn't more than just an embarrassing moment at worst, but come on, Trump. Really?  
  
I'm curious to know the details of how this was made public. That would give some more clarity. Not sure if that's available just yet, but it could either be another trap being set by Trump that will deliver later on, or just an embarrassing-as-Hell blunder that's going to fizzle out in a few weeks.  
  
Trump's arrogance is absolutely what makes him so great at dealing with certain issues, whether it be negotiating with China, bringing the Koreas closer than ever to a genuine chance at peace, dealing with the media, other politicians, etc. - but this might be an example of the cost of that arrogance. His greatest strength bites him in the ass at times, so depending on how this pans out, this may be another example of that. goddamnit I'm not seeing the problem here that some of my fellow conservatives are. It was quick and too the point while being rough around the edges. Typical Trump. I don't know what to say other than I am disappointed that the letter is real. [removed] This sub has been overrun. The brigading in this thread is insane. It appears that it's real so I say OOF to that. Realistically though - it's short and to the point, even if it's not pretty to look at. I'm getting a feeling that he *wants* Erdogan to slip up on purpose. Then, Turkey's government can be exposed for the piece of shit that it is. This would lead to sanctions not only from the US, but from other countries who deal with them as well. ""I know I gave you the green light to invade Syria, but now it's not polling well for me, so I need you to stop.  Also, can you arrange a photo op with Jared at Trump Towers Istanbul?"" Source? What is wrong with this letter? Yikes. We’re not expecting Hemingway, but come on...

Content is fine and I agree with it. Style leaves a lot to be desired. Donald Trump is a weak President. Putin, Erdogan, Jinping -- those are serious actors on the world stage who have played this President like a fiddle. We give Turkey what they want, and now Trump is trying to bargain from a position of strength? Really? And it's not even exclusive to Trump either, Obama was the same way except significantly worse.

It's evident to me that Putin, Erdogan, and Jinping do not take Trump seriously. No one does. And when legitimately evil people who are in control of evil regimes don't take the world's biggest super power seriously, then there's a big problem there. I mean it’s straight to the point.

This is such an obvious trolling.","Trump’s letter to Turkey’s Erdogan 😳Well, he sent it on the 9th and Turkey's continued their attacks.  Guess they've given their response. Am I reading it right that he is attaching, with his letter to Erdogan, a letter from the Kurdish general to Trump? Did the Kurdish general *want* the leader of the country attacking him to have that letter? What in the flying Hell? [removed] What..  
  
Edit: Just to flesh out what I'm thinking, my first instinct is that this is one if those Trump moments that don't really have a justification or a light side. I've been proven wrong on this sentiment pretty much any other time it's popped up (and God do I hope to be proven wrong again), but I really don't see how this is going to turn into some trap or bait that Trump manages to turn around.  
  
It doesnt change the fact that I still support pulling out of Syria, and it doesn't change 2020 for me in the slightest as this isn't more than just an embarrassing moment at worst, but come on, Trump. Really?  
  
I'm curious to know the details of how this was made public. That would give some more clarity. Not sure if that's available just yet, but it could either be another trap being set by Trump that will deliver later on, or just an embarrassing-as-Hell blunder that's going to fizzle out in a few weeks.  
  
Trump's arrogance is absolutely what makes him so great at dealing with certain issues, whether it be negotiating with China, bringing the Koreas closer than ever to a genuine chance at peace, dealing with the media, other politicians, etc. - but this might be an example of the cost of that arrogance. His greatest strength bites him in the ass at times, so depending on how this pans out, this may be another example of that. goddamnit I'm not seeing the problem here that some of my fellow conservatives are. It was quick and too the point while being rough around the edges. Typical Trump. I don't know what to say other than I am disappointed that the letter is real. [removed] This sub has been overrun. The brigading in this thread is insane. It appears that it's real so I say OOF to that. Realistically though - it's short and to the point, even if it's not pretty to look at. I'm getting a feeling that he *wants* Erdogan to slip up on purpose. Then, Turkey's government can be exposed for the piece of shit that it is. This would lead to sanctions not only from the US, but from other countries who deal with them as well. ""I know I gave you the green light to invade Syria, but now it's not polling well for me, so I need you to stop.  Also, can you arrange a photo op with Jared at Trump Towers Istanbul?"" Source? What is wrong with this letter? Yikes. We’re not expecting Hemingway, but come on...

Content is fine and I agree with it. Style leaves a lot to be desired. Donald Trump is a weak President. Putin, Erdogan, Jinping -- those are serious actors on the world stage who have played this President like a fiddle. We give Turkey what they want, and now Trump is trying to bargain from a position of strength? Really? And it's not even exclusive to Trump either, Obama was the same way except significantly worse.

It's evident to me that Putin, Erdogan, and Jinping do not take Trump seriously. No one does. And when legitimately evil people who are in control of evil regimes don't take the world's biggest super power seriously, then there's a big problem there. I mean it’s straight to the point. Not in flowery or diplomatic language but it succinctly addresses the issue, puts our interests right out there and puts the impetus on Erdogan to make a deal.

There are a few problems with the idea of ""getting rid of all nuclear weaponry"".

1. There is no way to guarantee that all nations actually did get rid of their nukes.  

2. There is no way to prevent countries that previously didn't have nukes from developing them in secret.  We got a nasty surprise a few years back when North Korea turned up with nukes, despite having agreed to not research them.  Its a fair bet that Iran is already a nuclear power despite claiming otherwise.

3. There is no way to prevent countries that actually got rid of their nukes from making more.

4. Nukes actually prevent conventional wars - odd as that seems.  The reason the US and USSR never went to war with conventional forces is that both sides recognized that if one began losing, it would result in a nuclear war.  India and Pakistan restrict themselves to low level border skirmishes for the same reasons.  Likewise, Israel's Arab neighbors haven't tried to invade since Carter revealed Israel was a nuclear power.

5. Nations with strong, aggressive neighbors will not give up their nukes.  Ukraine did in exchange for a promise by the US to defend them if they were attacked - and everyone saw how that worked out. This is the problem with leftist thinking. Yeah we want these things:

Nobody being in poverty.

Nobody dying from violence.

No nuclear weapons.

But you offer no realistic solutions. Just "" hey guys let's get rid of these things and problem solved"". 

Utopias don't exist. It's called mutually assured destruction.  Counties won't attack us because they know we could erase then from the earth.  Just like if you're robbing a house, you won't hit the one with a heavily armed family inside.  Weapons are just as much a deterrent as they are for killing. I agree, but sadly, you can't get toothpaste back in the tube. There’s a good argument that the lack of wars between major powers since WW2 is because of nuclear weapons. Even if we could guarantee everyone did get rid of theirs, which is a massive if, the end result could be more war and dead people than would otherwise have occurred. Didn't work out so well for Ukraine now did it? MAD has proven to work throughout the Cold War and continues to work. We can’t just dearm because the rest of the world will not, and once they realize the threat of mutually assured destruction is gone they will take advantage of it. As the sayings go, an armed society is a polite society. It's specifically beacuse people know that world leaders can ""destroy all life on Earth with one press of a button"" that no one should get rid of nuclear weaponry.

This is a classic case of the prisoner's dilemma. For those not in the know of what that is, imagine you're a criminal being questioned by the police. You know your accomplice was also caught and is also being questioned. For your crime the usual jail sentence is 10 years.

The police offer you a deal. Testify against your accomplice and you'll get away with just 3 years in prison while your accomplice is locked away for the full 10. However, if he also chooses to testify against you then your sentence is raised to 5 years.

But if neither of you testify, you (in this dilemma) cannot be sentenced because of a lack of evidence otherwise. There, though, you run the risk of serving your full 10 year sentence if he testifies against you when you choose not to do the same to him.

Do you testify? Why or not?

The fact of the matter is that in this situation you have to assume the worst will happen. In order to avoid the threat of 10 years in jail (here read ""sudden and immediate military action taken against you in your unarmed state""), you need to testify.

You have no way of knowing whether or not your accomplice will refuse to testify against you. Even if he says he won't, he's a criminal. How do you know he's not just trying to trick you into refusing to testify to secure the odds of him only serving 3 years instead of the 5 he would if you did?

Sorry, but the old movies got it wrong. It's not that the only way to win is to not play the game, it's to assume you'll have to eventually and be ready to minimize loss when you do. Nukes are not as powerful as you make them out to be.   [https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) I’m a centrist perusing this sub but this caught my eye. There is a pretty clear answer; we can’t. Too many nations have nuclear weapons or the capacity to do so. You don’t give up nukes if your enemy potentially has them or could have them.

Tuesday’s Democratic debate showed that Bernie Sanders still has some pep in his step, Joe Biden needs a better answer on his son Hunter’s business dealings, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar deserves more media respect. But the most important news was Senator Elizabeth Warren’s determined refusal to say if her plans would require taxes to increase on the middle class.

Ms. Warren, the new leader in the polls, was given at least six chances to answer yes or no. She ducked every time. “Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?” asked one of the media questioners.

Ms. Warren replied: “So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.” She then talked about her “70,000 selfies” and town halls.

The reporter tried again: “Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?”

Ms. Warren: “So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.”

This resort to “costs” to avoid mentioning taxes was too much for South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, who chimed in: “Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer.” He added, accurately, that “no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.”

Ms. Warren’s third verse was same as the first: “We can pay for this. I’ve laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They’re going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.”

Mr. Sanders, who wrote the Medicare for All bill that Ms. Warren has endorsed, then admitted what everyone except Ms. Warren admits, which is that taxes will rise for everybody: “At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.”

The media questioner then followed up: “Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the Senator just said about taxes going up?”

Ms. Warren: “So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hard-working, middle-class families.”

Next up was Senator Klobuchar, who said “at least Bernie’s being honest here and saying how he’s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I’m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice.”

The fifth time was not a charm as Ms. Warren again ducked the tax issue and spoke instead about Americans “going bankrupt over health-care costs.” Joe Biden then gave it a try, but you know Ms. Warren’s reply.

***
All of this illuminates a problem with Ms. Warren’s agenda and her political character. On Medicare for All, everyone agrees that the cost will be at least $32 trillion over 10 years. Ms. Warren could impose her wealth tax, her higher taxes on capital gains, her higher income taxes on the affluent, and she still wouldn’t come close to paying for Medicare for All. And that’s before her plans for new spending entitlements on child care, pre-K education, free college and so much more.

The only way to pay for this is to raise taxes on the middle class, which is where the real money is. That’s how government health care is financed in Europe, where the rich generally provide a smaller share of overall tax revenue than they do in the U.S. Democratic voters have to decide if they want a nominee who would eliminate private health insurance while dissembling about taxes.

Spinning fables is a habit for Ms. Warren. She spent years claiming to have Native American ancestry when it could help her career, only to apologize this year after the truth was exposed. More recently she said she left the workforce after having her first child because of sexism, which has been contradicted by official records and her own previous statements.

Democrats won’t be able to make the case against Mr. Trump’s falsehoods if their nominee is also dodging the truth. All of this argues for Democratic voters to take a deep breath and give other candidates a careful look. I'll take ""Net Cost"" for $400 Alex Did Warren turn into Ross Perot? lol","WSJ Editorial Board: Warren’s Middle-Class Tax Dodge>  **Article:**

Tuesday’s Democratic debate showed that Bernie Sanders still has some pep in his step, Joe Biden needs a better answer on his son Hunter’s business dealings, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar deserves more media respect. But the most important news was Senator Elizabeth Warren’s determined refusal to say if her plans would require taxes to increase on the middle class.

Ms. Warren, the new leader in the polls, was given at least six chances to answer yes or no. She ducked every time. “Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?” asked one of the media questioners.

Ms. Warren replied: “So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.” She then talked about her “70,000 selfies” and town halls.

That’s their thing, not ours. Here's the text of the letter from President Trump to President Erdogan of Turkey:

> Dear Mr. President:

> Let's work out a good deal! You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy — and I will. I've already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson.

> I have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don't let the world down. You can make a great deal. General Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past. I am confidentially enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received.

> History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!

> I will call you later.

FYI, the White House confirmed the letter is real. The worst part of the letter is the date it was sent and the obvious lack of reaction and response from turkey. Idk guys, I don’t really like what trump did with this one. Could be catastrophic, Erdogan is a fucked up dictator. [removed] I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

2. We had token forces deployed in the region. Not enough to project power against another nation.

3. The vast majority of our troops left last year after ISIS was defeated. As in literally Mission Accomplished.

4. Turkey did not ask permission, they notified us of their intent. Similar to when we notified Russia of our intent to blow up a Syrian airfield they may have had forces at. Our options were to either leave our forces who would be completely out numbered in harm's way or move them out. Trump choose the sane option.

5. People attacking Trump need to actually give an alternative based in reality. The Lindsey Graham's of the world need to state straight up that they would have threatened war with Turkey over the situation.

6. The Kurds in the region were situational allies. As in we had a mutual interest in destroying ISIS. Our long term interests do not align. This idea that we need to throw down for them comes from where?

7. Turkey is still a NATO ally. Arguably they have been a bad ally recently due to the arms agreement with Russia. But they have been crucial to us in the past.

8. This conflict 100% puts a wedge between Russia and Turkey. Syrian government is supported by Russia and is now in open conflict with Turkey.

With all this in mind we should be putting pressure on Turkey not to fuck this up. They should make peace with the Kurds if possible (though the conflict goes back centuries). They should also ensure ISIS is not let loose on the region. Russia, Syria, Kurds, Turkey, and the US are all in agreement on that front.

I'm also what libertarians would call an interventionist when it comes to American interests. All the supposed war Hawks are being retarded here. The left is being the left. Debate went bad for the dems so this is going to dominate tomorrow's news. Because of the brigadiers it’s impossible to have a substantive conversation among conservatives on foreign policy, the left it too dumb to understand it so they’re gonna support whatever is closest to “orange man bad” although that supposedly violates their pacifist principles. Mods should lock threads and ban anyone that comments on subs like TopMinds anytime there’s a brigade.


Also congratulations TopMinds there’s some dude claiming we “left” nukes for terrorists  because we have them at a base in Turkey and you guys are eating it up. Are people this brainwashed? I need to start a satire site. The more I learn about this Syria withdrawal I love trump even more. Turkey was clearly going to do this anyways, rather than get us in ANOTHER war the president used political leverage and is following through on that. The kurds signed a agreement with Syria to help. We save tax money, the middle east is handling their own business. Europe better start taking care of this, or Erdogan is going to open the floodgates potentially, so now they have to handle their own problems instead of stealing from us.

Our media and neolibs/neocons suck. F Lindsey Graham. The realist people right now are tucker and the Jimmy dore type real progressives calling this what it really is. Theres no way for us to not be interventionist without actually just leaving. Meanwhile the anti war supposedly folks like AOC who say they're for pulling out are now pro war again.

You can do whatever you like ranging from getting a job to starting a company, an organization, or doing something else, and you don't have to appeal to the government. You instead have to add value to someone's life or persuade people to invest in your organization, which while difficult it gives you tremendous options. In socialist societies, even if they worked, you would still have to get a job and you'd have very little say in what your place was in society. You'd wake up and do whatever a committee wanted with no option to form your own company or organization. The Federal Reserve and it's fiat currency has got to go before it blows.

The way they've been printing money by the pallet and shipping it to other countries to buy resources and assets with ""free"" money; 2% fixed inflation seems suspicuously low.


People might site fracrional reserve as being a wonderful invention that has only made us prosperous. But in the long haul it will lead to a devaluation that is terrifiying.

Yahoo comments are an untapped gold mine. Take nice browse one day, you'll thank yourself I think I saw this on Tinder. Could be a mushroom. They're weird. A blob with 720 sexes vs a blob with no balls. Sounds like an interesting presidential debate I thought that it was gender that the Left was insisting there are multiples of. If they're saying that there's now multiple sexes, then gender and sex really are the same things. Blob with 720 sexes? Scientific name: Rosieannus O'Donnellus. Give it a reality show on TLC Posted this on a left wing subreddit. The snowflakes are melting as we speak. Too perfect, a set -uph🤣🤣 Their still probably missing a few genders... It only has two sexes. But those sexes have 720 names. Life finds a way. 720 individual necessary sexual functions? There’s asexual with 1, sexual dimorphism with 2 (us), and maybe apples have 6. 720 though? [removed]"

Looks like Ben Shapiro was 100% wrong about this. I don't think she ever intended to put it to a vote. She was just caving in to the screams from the far left in her party. She thinks she is smooth enough to be able to keep Trump in a constant state of impeachment, but never have to actually do it, and that will satisfy.

She is wrong, she won't end up changing voters minds, and she won't end up appeasing the far left who are dead set on impeaching him. She will eventually end up giving in, but it won't be because of the White House, or the voters. It will be because her own party will toss her ass off the podium and snatch her gavel if she doesn't. The whole coup has been extralegal from the FISA courts on.  Democrats who support this are traitors in every sense of the word. Of course not, because she knows that an Impeachment and possible trial opens up the Dems to all sorts of scrutiny on the corruption that they have participated in.

It's a bold strategy, Cotton. A pardon is just that, a pardon. I’m no legal expert by any stretch but one would think an absolution such as a pardon precludes any ability to open further prosecution. It would be the same reasoning as prosecuting an innocent person would it not? For after a pardon you are now justified in the eyes of the law. Or might it fall under the domain of double jeopardy where someone may not be tried twice for the same crime? Does this mean we can push for Chelsea Manning to get the full 35 year sentence?

That right there is what they call irony. Clintons and Obama made a ton of money selling pardons days before leaving office.  NY will destroy the pardon selling market.

No, I am not taking about the second I’m talking about the fifth. The title is misleading and the story isn't well written. The President has the power to pardon Federal crimes, as most governors do for state crimes. There are some crimes that would be covered in both jurisdictions, like murder, kidnapping, or tax evasion. Keeping it simple, in all states murder is a crime, while there are some types of murder that are federal crimes, an example would be a terrorist bomb killing folks. In that case, a state could charge the terrorist with murder, even if the President pardoned the terrorist of the Federal crime. All the law does is remove a previous law that would have not allowed the state to charge the terrorist in my example. They may have done this to target Trump's pardons, but there is nothing irregular about this, it simply returns to the normal tenants of Federalism.","New law allows NY to prosecute those pardoned by PresidentThis will be interesting to watch and see how it plays out.

&#x200B;

Of course the AI goes about facial features and such.

I bet you if they include questions and psych analyses to the recognition, at some point, just giving a bunch of nonsense answers can make you come out with: ""Physical appearance: human, white, male.

Wow, it's not like there's sex based traits that make up your facial structure or anything!  /s No-Facial recognition does not diagnose mental illness Cause genderqueer and non-binary doesn’t exist so it’s doing it’s job perfectly. It is not sexist to be factual. “Algorithms rely on Outdated stereotypes of gender”. 

Do you mean science?  I thought they were the party of science? Apparently my brain's facial recognition program has the AI upgrade lol. This is the issue with making gender identity the standard for gender in general. Gender as sex is an external biological trait represented on the most fundamental level as XX or XY chromosomes. Gender as sex is observable. Gender as identity is purely cognitive. It is what you believe yourself to be. You can't see someone else's beliefs, you can't see what someone considers themselves to be, and you can't see what someone feels in a way that is objective. As such, the function of gender as an identifier (which is the purpose of gendered pronouns) becomes moot, this facial recognition AI is also affected as people may be offended by the truth. 

When someone says ""boy"" or ""girl"", they're not putting you in a box. They're looking at the box and seeing that it says ""boy"" or ""girl"". They didn't put you in that ""boy"" or ""girl"" box, it's literally the box you were born in. AI doesn't care; it sees an Adam's apple, it's a dude.

 I'd be more interested in an AI that could see those things.  This AI looks for genetic traits that are dominant in different genders. Not exceptionally difficult concept. An AI that could pick up on context clues? An honest to god gay-dar? That's impressive.

I would double it, because guess what? Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is -- like I said -- the -- a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.

Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are -- there’s $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can’t justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.

Basically, with the US no longer there the Kurds dream of an independent Kurdistan has gone belly up but all is not lost.  Assad has reportedly begun diplomacy with them to reintegrate them into the Syrian forces and a possible autonomous zone in Syria.  If this goes through the Syrian Civil war will be mostly over and may turn into a Turkey-Syria conflict.

If Turkey keeps going the way they are they will have diplomatically isolated themselves from the West (we are currently mulling over sanctions in response to their invasion) and the East (Syria is still an ally of Russia after all).  While many may dislike the pull back the consequences may actually be better in the long run.  NATO can start distancing itself from one of its worst allies and Syria may start to finally know peace. Interesting how all of the nations who refused to assist the Kurds when they were under siege by ISIS are now bad-mouthing the US for withdrawing troops from the same area. I don’t know why the POTUS just didn’t state that the US withdrawal was to make room for regional or even European powers to establish a foothold to stop the conflict. The US was never going to be able to broker a peace agreement between religious sects that have been trying to murder each other for the last couple millennia, and it's silly to think otherwise.  America is not Earth Police.  America cannot secure the border between it and Mexico so we shouldn't be in the business of securing the border between Syria and Turkey. and hes not wrong Sad times when Democrats are for wars these days. That's one of the reasons Trump was elected. Bush and Obama where opposite sides of the same coin. Also people don't seem to grasp that Turkey is a NATO member. SO we should side with a group against our NATO member, who shares a border with this group? If Trump did side with the Kurds, then he would betray a NATO member. Seriously, why are we even over there in the first place? Makes no sense. I'm so upset US soldiers will no longer be used as meat shields. And he is 100 percent correct.

This historically accurate model predicts exactly that,Conservative,bobbyw24,t5_2qh6p,diqqd2,"Everyone loves optimism, and for the most part this article is very confidence inspiring, but the title (and article) are grossly misleading. I just want everyone to set expectations appropriately because complacency could really kill us in 2020. It's vastly more important to be skeptical, yet motivated, than it is to be optimistic, yet lazy.

Per the data from [Moody's Analytics](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2019/president-election-model.pdf) (cited in the article), the case for a Trump landslide in 2020 [only holds true *if* voter turnout is at an all-time low](https://i.imgur.com/d02LyKt.png). Given that the '18 midterm election had record turnout, it'd be imprudent and risky not to entertain our own worst-case scenario. The Moody's analysis warns of high turnout so I think it's safe to say I'm not alone in stating this:

> “Under the current Moody’s Analytics baseline economic outlook, which does not forecast any recession, the 2020 election looks like Trump’s to lose,” the authors wrote. “Democrats can still win if they are able to turn out the vote at record levels, but, under normal turnout conditions, the president is projected to win.”

In short: Let's not allow confidence to erode our sense of urgency. 

This election is being viewed, by leaders and populations across the globe, as a make-or-break judgement for our movement. If we fail, this movement will be hindered for at least the next decade. Again, the article is encouraging, but we can't allow our prospects to be solely based on low turnout - especially when it's almost unanimous that that's highly unlikely.

Communists looked at what he said and thought ""hmm, if we replace machines with slave labor, we can get to that day now."" They were wrong. They still are.

Marx vocally disagreed with political revolutions. If it takes a revolution to get to socialism, he realized it was too early to work.

>On July 31, 2015, Orrick blocked the release of videos of Planned Parenthood, granting the injunction requested by the National Abortion Federation.[10] Because The Center for Medical Progress allegedly illegally recorded undercover videos that plaintiffs claimed were heavily edited to purport to show that Planned Parenthood had been inappropriately selling fetal tissue, Orrick issued a restraining order. He said that he reached his decision due to concerns over the physical safety of the executive leadership of the National Abortion Federation. Orrick wrote, “NAF would be likely to suffer irreparable injury, absent an ex parte temporary restraining order, in the form of harassment, intimidation, violence, invasion of privacy, and injury to reputation, and the requested relief is in the public interest.”[11] He scheduled a contempt hearing for June 14, 2017, for the defendants' attorneys, due to a violation of his restraining order.[12]

>According to the Public Citizen, a non-profit, consumer rights advocacy group, Orrick III, who was employed by the law firm Coblentz Patch Duffy & Bass, raised at least $200,000 for Barack Obama[18] and donated $30,800 to committees supporting him.

That's insane... These policies would devastate the US I went back and looked at his voting record a couple months back.  The only thing he's consistently voted in favor of is immigration issues.  He's voted against all but 1 gun legislation bill.  He's voted against the majority of environmental regulation.  He's even voted against a few tax hikes in his time.  Shockingly,  he even voted against student loan forgiveness legislation at one point. 

 In the last 4 month's, he's only voted once.  He has never,  not once ever,  attempted,  or introduced a health care bill of any kind, not even a student loan reduction or forgiveness bill.

In my opinion,  he's not a socialist at all.  He's a financial predator, and he's preying on those who refuse to research his history.

I seriously think the media pundits will have a mental break down  when he wins. It’ll be astounding. Not only that, but we’ll be all but assured more SC Justices. As a Minnesotan I will be shocked as hell if we turn Red. Not that I can’t happen, there is a chance. But I just don’t see it happening. So it’s interesting this model has us turning red. Guess we’ll see. I’m from Minnesota and I’m trying to get all my friends to vote red but they say it’s a waste of time to go in and vote. ###MAKE SURE YOU STILL VOTE! 

edit: Dont assume its going to be a guaranteed win. Don't get complacent. We've seen how models and predictions don't really work/apply to Trump.  
It's going to be a tough election. All of this bullshit going on with the democrats and the media 100% behind them and we haven't even flipped the calendar to 2020 yet. If will be a full on onslaught from the dems/media the closer we get to next November. Is it any question at this point? The election is about a year away now and the DNC was supposed to have their shit together but they're far from being on schedule. Trump's re-election will be the least surprising thing to happen in all of political history. I am a California native and I am so sick and tired of the west coast leftist echo chamber here. Maybe one day California will become red again (or even yellow). COMPLACENCY IS SIN. All hands on deck people I'm safe with believing that even polls such as this one are shoveled out as a 'disarming' tactic.

More dumb, subliminal manipulation games... Get your asses out and vote, regardless of what sources scry. We have to make sure to vote overwhelmingly.  If not, if the Democrats are behind by just a little, they will all of a sudden find this locked closet with all these ballot in them.  And some Democrat appointed Judge will rule they all have to be counted.  And then low and behold, we just found this semi-truck full of all these uncounted votes.  Better make sure we count them too.  I am not even joking about this. Only if we all vote! Democrats went even further in the wrong direction, rather than reformed their party. It looks really bad for them right now. Vote vote vote no complacency no mercy!!! And whatever you do, don't tell the Dems about this poll, as it says if they have a record turnout, they could win. So let them think that they are actually in the majority and will have an easy victory. Every dem that doesn't vote takes us that much closer to 4 more  years. The election is still over a year away.  Don't let your guard down!  The 2020 salt harvest will be Bigly! I believe we are going to see a red tsunami. The silent majority has been at boiling point for some time now. How long will they be called the enemy and remain silent? A deplorable? A Nazi? The democrat party has completely come unhinged since 2016 and 2020 will be the harbinger of their complete splintering. The Republican Party will come out in droves in 2020 mark my words. Furthermore, look for African American voters to increase for Trump in 2020, much to the chagrin of the MSM, Maxine and Kamala. Don't get cocky. Some of those blue states go by national poplar vote, so they would be red in theory. I don’t give a flying damn what any poll or “expert” predicts. People just need to get out and vote. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were won by *very* thin margins, and it only takes one scandal, gaffe, or well-placed Democratic hit piece to shift them back.  Virginia and Ohio are by no means a sure thing, either. It comes down to turnout. ""Turnout"" being defined as ""People who vote, plus people Democrats say voted"".","Trump Will ""Steamroll The Competition"" In 2020, Moody's Election Model PredictsThat's reassuring and all, but we still need to get out there and vote. Those polls in 2016 saying Hillary would win by 99% caused the Dems to be complacent. We can't let that happen to us. Don't trust any polls.  Get out and vote as if it's the closest race ever. I seriously think the media pundits will have a mental break down  when he wins. It’ll be astounding. Not only that, but we’ll be all but assured more SC Justices. As a Minnesotan I will be shocked as hell if we turn Red. Not that I can’t happen, there is a chance. But I just don’t see it happening. So it’s interesting this model has us turning red. Guess we’ll see. I’m from Minnesota and I’m trying to get all my friends to vote red but they say it’s a waste of time to go in and vote. ###MAKE SURE YOU STILL VOTE! 

edit: Dont assume its going to be a guaranteed win. Don't get complacent. We've seen how models and predictions don't really work/apply to Trump.  
It's going to be a tough election. All of this bullshit going on with the democrats and the media 100% behind them and we haven't even flipped the calendar to 2020 yet. If will be a full on onslaught from the dems/media the closer we get to next November. Is it any question at this point? The election is about a year away now and the DNC was supposed to have their shit together but they're far from being on schedule. Trump's re-election will be the least surprising thing to happen in all of political history. I am a California native and I am so sick and tired of the west coast leftist echo chamber here. Maybe one day California will become red again (or even yellow). COMPLACENCY IS SIN. All hands on deck people I'm safe with believing that even polls such as this one are shoveled out as a 'disarming' tactic.

More dumb, subliminal manipulation games... Get your asses out and vote, regardless of what sources scry. We have to make sure to vote overwhelmingly.  If not, if the Democrats are behind by just a little, they will all of a sudden find this locked closet with all these ballot in them.  And some Democrat appointed Judge will rule they all have to be counted.  And then low and behold, we just found this semi-truck full of all these uncounted votes.

Really makes you think, huh? So Trump can't block people, but Twitter can block him. 

Got it. Wannabe dictator. I am scared for this country. Thank god I’ll be dead by the time real change from them will happen After that I'm gonna go watch that Trump video meme again lol I'll put money on Twitter banning Trump a month before the election. It's all gonna start with the media saying they're needs to be conversation about the dangers of presidential hate speech, and ""why hasn't Twitter protected the public from the president?"" Then Twitter will say they regret that they have no other choice but to ban the president for hate speech.

Tag it. Almost as bad as “let’s be friends” booker the hooker. 

Wherever the president and his fans go, I go. Fuck Twitter. Queen Kamala doesn't have time for the Bill of Rights. She wants someone in jail, now!

Even among the left Harris didn’t earn any new votes with this interchange and I think her campaign is continuing to tank. I would love to see Twitter delete his entire account. I really would. Watch how fast these tech. giants are changed from private companies to public platforms where Freespeech is MANDATORY.

Bush could be considered a war criminal the way he conducted his illegal war in Iraq and endorsed torture. And I don't even want him silenced on any platform. Apparently censoring and distorting the President in the mainstream media is not enough for Harris. She wants more. MORE! muhahahaha And I thought going in that she was the favorite.  That really went south in a hurry and it keeps getting worse.  She should drop out before she makes herself unelectable even in California.

If a place requires you to surrender your ability to protect yourself they 100% should be liable to protect you. If they fail they should be held financially/criminally responsible. ~~""Gun Free Zone""~~ ""Unarmed People Here!""

100% yes Well it is a proven fact they do make a target rich environment. I don't expect anything to change but eventually there will be a list that says...

Gun Free Zone

Mass Murder Free Zone

Rape Free Zone

Crime Free Zone

Rational Thought Free Zone

Designated Safe Place (Unless shooting starts then run like hell) I thought that those who established a weapon free zone needed to set up some means of protection for those in the area. America: Let's ban shooting criminals!  
S. Africa: Let's toast criminals with vehicle-mounted flamethrower!  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLhWzMOccTg God bless my state delegates. I believe that West Virginia allows you to conceal carry without a permit. I've met some West Virginians who work for the government in some capacity and they are unable to take their weapons with them to work... including leaving them in their car. I imagine some private businesses are the same.

Anyway, for some places of work it's fine. Parking is in a concentrated, well lit area. But others are not, and depending on the area or someone's personal history they may be at risk of being mugged or assaulted by an ex or something. That's how it works with the police.  They are under NO OBLIGATION whatsoever to protect the public (according to the Supreme Court), even if you have a protective order.   Your God-given right to self-defense takes over.

If you are in custody, you've lost your ability to defend yourself, and the police have an obligation (in theory) to protect you.  It should be the same with gun-free zones.  If they remove your right to self-defense, they are obligated to provide your defense. Interesting.  I disagree on it because it's the same logic the left use to ban in the first place.  But it'd be interesting to see this get mainstream traction because it circles the lack of stage 2 thinking back onto the left.  (And that's why this won't get mainstream coverage)

EDIT: spelling Makes sense. If you are going to demand that I disarm myself to enter your ""zone"" you are responsible for my security. If you fail to provide security you're legally/financially responsible. Doctor, I concur.

Edit: Had a thought. To enter gun-free zone you must sign a waiver of your rights being taken away. I like it. That makes nothing but sense. Bereaved or shooting survivors could also just sue the relevant government on a common law/jury nullification basis to try to achieve the same end. By that logic, if shootings occur in areas where guns are allowed, those who have a firearm and the police should be held liable for shooting injuries.","W.Va. delegate seeks to hold 'no-gun zones' legally liable for shooting injuriesThats actually a damn good idea...

Edit: Had a thought. To enter gun-free zone you must sign a waiver of your rights being taken away. I like it. That makes nothing but sense. Bereaved or shooting survivors could also just sue the relevant government on a common law/jury nullification basis to try to achieve the same end. By that logic, if shootings occur in areas where guns are allowed, those who have a firearm and the police should be held liable for shooting injuries."

I can respect that. I certainly don't agree with her on a lot but she is the most sane, down to earth person.  Someone who probably can be reasoned with and despite our political differences, I can respect her.  But that all the reasons why she has no chance to be the nominee.

Which is kind of amazing.  If she was nominated, she could probably beat Trump easily, just on her sanity and personality alone. She also doesn't have the typical shady past as the other career politicians. I think she'd get a lot of Independents. Weird how she thinks and speaks like an actual adult. ""when I look at an AR-15, I see a weapon of war."". Also Tulsi.

I will never vote for an Army veteran who doesn't have enough integrity to admit that an AR-15 is not an M16. This is the election for the Intersectionals, so Tusli who is a more Obama-style candidate has no chance.  She's no moderate by any stretch, but she comes off as sane. As a conservative I hope that Tulsi is playing the long game here.  She's got to remain sane compared to the left and watch them fail.

This country is far better off when both the right and the left are closer together, and Tulsi (while I don't agree with many of her policies) is better suited than others on that stage. If this woman won the nomination Trump might actually have a problem. That is why she cannot win a democrat primary. 

She is hoping for a nod as VP pick to offset the bucket of crazy that will win the nomination. She was the only respectable candidate on that stage and the efforts of the media puppets to smear her tell the full story of what the DNC is all about Honestly her and Yang are the only ones I respect. Though I disagree with many of their policies, they are never pandering. Unlike the other candidates, they don’t insult half of Americans as bigots and racists. They see problems and want to help, though the ways they want to I disagree with.

They are the only candidates that say “this is why you should vote for me” instead of “this is why you can’t vote for Trump!” All I ask of the Democrats is, don't hate me just because I disagree. Things she supports that are crazy:

1. Federal minimum wage increased to $15 per hour
2. Supports reparations.
3. College should be free.
4. Eliminate the electoral college.
5. Close down nuclear power plants.
6. ""Assault weapon"" ban.
7. Government sponsored universal health care.
8. Expanding DACA.
9. Supports more stringent ""climate change"" legislations.

Things she supports that aren't crazy:

1. Negotiating prices for Medicare.
2. Stoping the spying of the US government on it's citizens.
3. Ending the war on drugs.

This is all from her own website without even touching her stance on abortion, gay rights, her foreign policy, or how she will pay for all the spending she has in planned. She says ""maybe everyone isn't deplorable"" and we're supposed to like her now? She's hardly even playing to moderates. The only likeable things I've ever seen on her are literally sound bites of her saying something snappy. She has no chance is swinging anyone that is informed to vote Dem that wasn't already going to. Still a lefty.  Any time before 2008 she would've been the extreme left.  Now she sounds reasonable.

Don't fall for it. When this loon appears moderate it tells you how far off the deep end the left has gone. She is not a conservative. If she is conservative, she would run on a Republican ticket, not on a Democrat ticket.

She is sane on some of her policies, but she too follows the party line on some of other issues. 

She wants to ban military-style weapons:

> “We don’t have to wait for answers to these questions for Congress to pass legislation already supported by a majority of Americans, like universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole and reinstating a federal ban on military-style assault weapons.”  

&#x200B;

>Here are a few examples: Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation I have co-sponsored to ban bump stocks. 

She is also a supporter of DACA, clearly seen in her history.

> Most urgently, we must pass DACA to ensure children who know no other home are allowed to remain in the US and take steps to ensure children are not separated from their parents.  

She is also another crazy renewable people that wanted 100% renewable energy while toning down a clear solution to energy problem: nuclear energy

> “We need to invest in 100% renewable and safe energy sources like wind, solar, and geothermal. I also support a ban on fracking, ending the $26 billion/year in fossil fuel subsidies, as well as all subsidies or waivers to the nuclear power industry 

She also wanted college for all, and eliminating student debt, just like Bernie Sanders.

> “The cost of tuition keeps too many people from pursuing a college education. We need to resolve student debt and guarantee college for all.” 

She is also a supporter of Medicare of All

> As president, I will work to ensure all Americans have quality healthcare incentivized to increase health and prevent and heal disease.” 

All of the above quotes are taken from her own campaign website. All of the above comments show that she is not a conservative, just another Democrats who have better common sense. I'm a right-libertarian...and I love Tulsi Gabbard.  She is the closest thing the dems have to an honest politician who is legitimately anti-war.  Of course, I think she's wrong on just about every economic issue and probably half of social issues, but she is genuine, kind, and honest...which is more than you can say for 90% of politicians. She's trying to take over Biden's lane.

I think the Dems as a group are too far crazy left to nominate her though. Still way too far to the left and a huge gun grabber. Nope. I appreciate her for torpedoing Kamala Harris's campaign chances, but a few nice soundbites does not make a good or reasonable candidate. Take a look at some of her platform and you'll see she's just as much of a gun-grabbing, blow-out-the-spending Dem as the rest of the field. I believe she's left of Obama, and I believe that Obama was the farthest left of any president since FDR. Please correct me if I'm wrong on these, but I think I'm close.

Democrats have perfected the art of getting what they want by saying extreme crazy shit and then ""moderating"" to the liberal thing they really want. I really wish Republicans would learn how to do that. Instead Republicans shift to the left anytime they get spooked by someone calling them too far right. Democrats double-down and then ""settle"" on the thing that they actually wanted all along.

Obama was called ""center-right"". [Here's the first google result for this](https://www.democraticunderground.com/1002303013). Obama [said himself](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/272957-obama-says-his-economic-policies-so-mainstream-hed-be-seen-as-moderate-republican-in-1980s) that he would have been a moderate Republican in the 1980s. I don't know what world they're living in where they thing the US has moved to the right since the 1980s, but this is what they believe. Obama was directly [called a conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/obama-is-a-republican/) by people claiming to be conservatives, and supported by so-called establishment ""conservatives"". 

By any objective measure, we've moved to the left. We have candidates for president openly supporting socialism by name, illegal immigration, free-shit-o-rama, now a ""wealth tax"", and enforcing ""gender identity"" in law. Meanwhile, Republicans don't make any hint at balancing a budget and have stopped pushing back on any social issues except making some headway on abortion - they simply lightly hold the brakes instead of trying to right the course.

Gabbard is the result. I believe she will fall left of Obama, but she'll be called ""center-right"" and probably painted as right of Obama, even though that only makes sense in relative terms. She's the intended ""compromise"". She's what they really want - which isn't a good thing - that only looks acceptable because they keep saying crazy shit.

She won't win this year. Every candidate against an incumbent is the throwaway candidate. Mondale, Dole, Kerry, and Romney were all crap candidates that had their ""turn"". Clinton and Reagan were kinda odd exceptions that had odd circumstances around them. Gabbard is too good to waste on an incumbent.

However, I predict that she will give a rousing speech at the convention, similar to Obama's speech in 2004, which will give her a boost into 2024.

I just wish the GOP was better at this game. So many brothers and sisters. She has some shining moments and then she has some where she goes completely antithetical on policy for me

Gabbard's only 38. This is basically a practice run for her. Mark my words. She'll be back

If Hillary could body swap with her she'd do it in a heartbeat. WTF a democrat that doesnt hate me for believing 98% the same thing instead of 100% the same thing. What is this the 90s? If I were to write in a name, I’d probably put her. But trump is doing too many things right to not re-elect. I like her general messaging here but honestly this only seems good because most of the other Democrats are such far left assholes.  I mean this should come without having to say it.  Trump despite his controversial and a lot of times supposedly controversial statements has never vilified actual Democratic voters.  He has said a lot about Democrat politicians but never anything bad about people who vote that way.  It's just sad that she even deserves recognition for this, but that's a problem with their party. You guys, anybody would look sane next to this crop of candidates. Do not be fooled. She is not on our side whatsoever. Uh, no thanks.  And anyone that can even consider supporting her after viewing her policy positions.... Buh bye.  👋 * Points for Lincoln
* Points for not using McCain
* Points for unity message

And NYT/CNN moderators call on you in inverse proportion to points I think this is just calculation.  I think if she were elected, she would run the presidency just like every other democrat out there.  Bigger government, more taxes, less freedom.  It's smart.  She's parroting Trumps smartest talking points, but she's still a democrat and there's no way she'd say, push for conservative judges or back an abortion bill. Democrats gonna get her some glasses.  Under M4A, she'd be covered. I fucking love how well spoken Tulsi is. Additionally she can reach across the isle; I agreed with all she just said apart from the ""we must defeat Trump"" sentence, which is actually not objectionable considering it's her job as a democrat. And that's all, only one sentence, from a democrat! She has a real path to the presidency one day, but I don't think it will be in 2020. Her and yang have slowly become by favorite dems. I guess that means they are russian assets now and white nationalists. Really pisses me off when people say she's basically a conservative. Shes a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Don't trust her. Am I supposed to say thank you? While I may not agree with her politics, she's smart and she generally has consistent principles.  Unlike Sanders, Warren, and O'Rourke, she's actually *done things* in life.  She was the Vice Chair for the DNC.  By any fair metric, she should be the front-runner for the nomination.

Problem is, she bucked the company line with the DNC, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz pushed her out.  Now she's running from the outside. Ignoring policies, she is by far the sanest politician on that stage along with Yang. If I just had to change one thing, I wouldn't talk about winning 2020 as ""defeating Donald Trump"", I think that contributes to the divide she was mentioning. I don't think your political opposition is someone to be *defeated*, it's someone to work *with*. She's deeply wrong on some fundamental issues, but unlike every other candidate, she's seems to be neither insane nor an idiot.   Like others here, I can respect a candidate like Gabbard, and unlike most of the other candidates, I agree with at least some of what she says, and find those things refreshingly logical.

Others are saying below that she could beat Trump... I don't know if that's true... but none of the front-running fruitcakes from the Democrat Candidate Clown Car have a chance.   I wish we had a world where someone like Gabbard could be more prominent, someone that actually deserves some respect and is neither a knave nor a fool. I could see myself voting for her... and she's gone. [removed] She was one of the better democratic candidates who seemed at least somewhat Centrist. Plus good looking as well She is probably is one of the few that could challenge Trump. I do, they're called leftists When you hear one of the Dems actually show you some tacit respect, you realize how absolutely tired you are of the hateful, vitriolic rhetoric spewed by people like Warren, Booker, and especially Lightweight O'Dork. 

If one of them takes this tack of showing all Americans respect, watch out. Very nice, thank you Tulsi! “I’m totally not Hillary Clinton pls nominate me”. She's getting rail roaded by CNN Well it’s a start I respect people like her who don constantly Bombard, the other side with insults and is respectful toward them. I think she half believes this (half not), still something. But I also think it's just positions she is taking to try to get the moderates knowing the corp dems and corp media watching progs believe the lies and she won't get the support. It also helps her get individual contributions to stay in the spotlight and hopefully debates.

I do somewhat like her. Just wish her domestic policy wasn't essentially the same as Bernie's. She'd be an amazing centrist. I do like the anti interventionism, and I think having discussions with Assad to at least try statesmanship was a positive. Dems lost their mind on that stuff. 

Someones our  enemy and threatening the world, shhhh don't talk to them!!! Nonsense. Unless you disagree with her on foreign policy in which case you're an evil warmonger who wants US soldiers to die. She is not a moderate in any way. Trump 2020! Policy wise her and I disagree on a good 90% of things. However, we need more politicians like Tulsi, Yang ect. They are genuine and more importantly they do not have a serious hatred for the country in their hearts. She's educated, has military service, successful, and beautiful. As a republican she'd be amazing. As a democrat they point at her and go ""look we have military personnel as well""

Quite sad. ""I don't see Americans as terrible people"" is basically radical thinking on the left these days And this is why she is a ""nazi"" /s Tulsi is the only candidate in my opinion that can get moderate conservatives to vote democrat. Tulsi  and Andrew Yang talk and act like a real people, the rest of the democrats running for president are over the top cartoon characters I hate her policies but dam she is a bombshell babe. Gabbard and Yang are the only democrats that show some promise I just don’t understand how liberals think running far left is a good idea for elections. The RNC is probably drooling all over themselves imagine how incredibly easy it will be to take down Warren. Socialism and tax hikes are bad words in elections.  I just don’t understand the thought process. They will get the turnout from their minority far left constituents while the middle stays home, or gasp, votes for Trump.  Do they really think the “enthusiasm” from the far left is enough to carry anything outside of California and New York?

Thank god they are pushing people like Gabbard down. Her, Biden, and Pete are probably the only ones that can carry the far left, moderates and independents to the booths. I’m glad that they are so obsessed with Warren and Sanders.

It’s funny that they cried loudly so the DNC for all intents and purposes eliminated Superdelegates. After they end up with a socialist like Warren or Sanders, I can’t wait for them to cry when they lose because they nominated someone so incredibly unelectable. Not that they will blame themselves anyways; I’m sure they will find something else Trump “did” to blame. Uh oh, tulsi just lost any chance she had at winning the D nomination Muh Racism Gabbard. People who praise her are useful... to Democrats. I'm gonna parrot what a lot of people are saying. I disagree with a lot of her proposals, especially in regards to the 2A, but she hasn't lost her mind. If she changed her mind on the 2A, I could vote for her, not like the DNC would nominate her anyway A partial transcript is as follows: 

ANDERSON COOPER: We would like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us, what impact it had on you, and your beliefs.


REP. TULSI GABBARD: Where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know we greet each other with “aloha.” The challenge before us is our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership I seek to bring as president. Inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all. When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans You can tell she's auditioning for a cabinet spot in the new Trump Administration. She’s still an evil piece of trash, I don’t care what she has to say. Tulsi has no genuine interest in securing the *Democratic* nomination. She's interested in providing a critique and pushing her not at all liberal policies Trump should really shake things up and ask her to be his 2020 running mate.","Tulsi Gabbard: 'When I Look Out at our Country, I Don't See Deplorables'she seems to be the most reasonable of that crazy bunch... so no chance for her.

I think the Dems as a group are too far crazy left to nominate her though. Still way too far to the left and a huge gun grabber. Nope. I appreciate her for torpedoing Kamala Harris's campaign chances, but a few nice soundbites does not make a good or reasonable candidate. Take a look at some of her platform and you'll see she's just as much of a gun-grabbing, blow-out-the-spending Dem as the rest of the field. I believe she's left of Obama, and I believe that Obama was the farthest left of any president since FDR. Please correct me if I'm wrong on these, but I think I'm close.

Democrats have perfected the art of getting what they want by saying extreme crazy shit and then ""moderating"" to the liberal thing they really want. I really wish Republicans would learn how to do that. Instead Republicans shift to the left anytime they get spooked by someone calling them too far right. Democrats double-down and then ""settle"" on the thing that they actually wanted all along.

Obama was called ""center-right"". [Here's the first google result for this](https://www.democraticunderground.com/1002303013). Obama [said himself](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/272957-obama-says-his-economic-policies-so-mainstream-hed-be-seen-as-moderate-republican-in-1980s) that he would have been a moderate Republican in the 1980s. I don't know what world they're living in where they thing the US has moved to the right since the 1980s, but this is what they believe. Obama was directly [called a conservative](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/obama-is-a-republican/) by people claiming to be conservatives, and supported by so-called establishment ""conservatives"". 

By any objective measure, we've moved to the left. We have candidates for president openly supporting socialism by name, illegal immigration, free-shit-o-rama, now a ""wealth tax"", and enforcing ""gender identity"" in law. Meanwhile, Republicans don't make any hint at balancing a budget and have stopped pushing back on any social issues except making some headway on abortion - they simply lightly hold the brakes instead of trying to right the course.

Gabbard is the result. I believe she will fall left of Obama, but she'll be called ""center-right"" and probably painted as right of Obama, even though that only makes sense in relative terms. She's the intended ""compromise"". She's what they really want - which isn't a good thing - that only looks acceptable because they keep saying crazy shit.

She won't win this year. Every candidate against an incumbent is the throwaway candidate. Mondale, Dole, Kerry, and Romney were all crap candidates that had their ""turn"". Clinton and Reagan were kinda odd exceptions that had odd circumstances around them. Gabbard is too good to waste on an incumbent.

However, I predict that she will give a rousing speech at the convention, similar to Obama's speech in 2004, which will give her a boost into 2024.

I just wish the GOP was better at this game. So many brothers and sisters. She has some shining moments and then she has some where she goes completely antithetical on policy for me

Gabbard's only 38. This is basically a practice run for her. Mark my words. She'll be back

If Hillary could body swap with her she'd do it in a heartbeat. WTF a democrat that doesnt hate me for believing 98% the same thing instead of 100% the same thing. What is this the 90s? If I were to write in a name, I’d probably put her. But trump is doing too many things right to not re-elect. I like her general messaging here but honestly this only seems good because most of the other Democrats are such far left assholes.  I mean this should come without having to say it.  Trump despite his controversial and a lot of times supposedly controversial statements has never vilified actual Democratic voters.  He has said a lot about Democrat politicians but never anything bad about people who vote that way.  It's just sad that she even deserves recognition for this, but that's a problem with their party. You guys, anybody would look sane next to this crop of candidates. Do not be fooled. She is not on our side whatsoever. Uh, no thanks.  And anyone that can even consider supporting her after viewing her policy positions.... Buh bye.  👋 * Points for Lincoln
* Points for not using McCain
* Points for unity message

And NYT/CNN moderators call on you in inverse proportion to points I think this is just calculation.  I think if she were elected, she would run the presidency just like every other democrat out there.  Bigger government, more taxes, less freedom.  It's smart.  She's parroting Trumps smartest talking points, but she's still a democrat and there's no way she'd say, push for conservative judges or back an abortion bill. Democrats gonna get her some glasses.  Under M4A, she'd be covered. I fucking love how well spoken Tulsi is. Additionally she can reach across the isle; I agreed with all she just said apart from the ""we must defeat Trump"" sentence, which is actually not objectionable considering it's her job as a democrat. And that's all, only one sentence, from a democrat! She has a real path to the presidency one day, but I don't think it will be in 2020. Her and yang have slowly become by favorite dems. I guess that means they are russian assets now and white nationalists. Really pisses me off when people say she's basically a conservative. Shes a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Don't trust her. Am I supposed to say thank you? While I may not agree with her politics, she's smart and she generally has consistent principles.  Unlike Sanders, Warren, and O'Rourke, she's actually *done things* in life.  She was the Vice Chair for the DNC.  By any fair metric, she should be the front-runner for the nomination.

Problem is, she bucked the company line with the DNC, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz pushed her out.  Now she's running from the outside. Ignoring policies, she is by far the sanest politician on that stage along with Yang. If I just had to change one thing, I wouldn't talk about winning 2020 as ""defeating Donald Trump"", I think that contributes to the divide she was mentioning. I don't think your political opposition is someone to be *defeated*, it's someone to work *with*. She's deeply wrong on some fundamental issues, but unlike every other candidate, she's seems to be neither insane nor an idiot.   Like others here, I can respect a candidate like Gabbard, and unlike most of the other candidates, I agree with at least some of what she says, and find those things refreshingly logical.

Others are saying below that she could beat Trump... I don't know if that's true... but none of the front-running fruitcakes from the Democrat Candidate Clown Car have a chance.   I wish we had a world where someone like Gabbard could be more prominent, someone that actually deserves some respect and is neither a knave nor a fool. I could see myself voting for her... and she's gone. [removed] She was one of the better democratic candidates who seemed at least somewhat Centrist. Plus good looking as well She is probably is one of the few that could challenge Trump. I do, they're called leftists When you hear one of the Dems actually show you some tacit respect, you realize how absolutely tired you are of the hateful, vitriolic rhetoric spewed by people like Warren, Booker, and especially Lightweight O'Dork. 

If one of them takes this tack of showing all Americans respect, watch out. Very nice, thank you Tulsi! “I’m totally not Hillary Clinton pls nominate me”. She's getting rail roaded by CNN Well it’s a start I respect people like her who don constantly Bombard, the other side with insults and is respectful toward them. I think she half believes this (half not), still something. But I also think it's just positions she is taking to try to get the moderates knowing the corp dems and corp media watching progs believe the lies and she won't get the support. It also helps her get individual contributions to stay in the spotlight and hopefully debates.

I do somewhat like her. Just wish her domestic policy wasn't essentially the same as Bernie's. She'd be an amazing centrist. I do like the anti interventionism, and I think having discussions with Assad to at least try statesmanship was a positive. Dems lost their mind on that stuff. 

Someones our  enemy and threatening the world, shhhh don't talk to them!!! Nonsense. Unless you disagree with her on foreign policy in which case you're an evil warmonger who wants US soldiers to die. She is not a moderate in any way. Trump 2020! Policy wise her and I disagree on a good 90% of things. However, we need more politicians like Tulsi, Yang ect. They are genuine and more importantly they do not have a serious hatred for the country in their hearts. She's educated, has military service, successful, and beautiful. As a republican she'd be amazing. As a democrat they point at her and go ""look we have military personnel as well""

Quite sad. ""I don't see Americans as terrible people"" is basically radical thinking on the left these days And this is why she is a ""nazi"" /s Tulsi is the only candidate in my opinion that can get moderate conservatives to vote democrat. Tulsi  and Andrew Yang talk and act like a real people, the rest of the democrats running for president are over the top cartoon characters I hate her policies but dam she is a bombshell babe. Gabbard and Yang are the only democrats that show some promise I just don’t understand how liberals think running far left is a good idea for elections. The RNC is probably drooling all over themselves imagine how incredibly easy it will be to take down Warren. Socialism and tax hikes are bad words in elections.  I just don’t understand the thought process. They will get the turnout from their minority far left constituents while the middle stays home, or gasp, votes for Trump.  Do they really think the “enthusiasm” from the far left is enough to carry anything outside of California and New York?

Thank god they are pushing people like Gabbard down. Her, Biden, and Pete are probably the only ones that can carry the far left, moderates and independents to the booths. I’m glad that they are so obsessed with Warren and Sanders.

It’s funny that they cried loudly so the DNC for all intents and purposes eliminated Superdelegates. After they end up with a socialist like Warren or Sanders, I can’t wait for them to cry when they lose because they nominated someone so incredibly unelectable. Not that they will blame themselves anyways; I’m sure they will find something else Trump “did” to blame. Uh oh, tulsi just lost any chance she had at winning the D nomination Muh Racism Gabbard. People who praise her are useful... to Democrats. I'm gonna parrot what a lot of people are saying. I disagree with a lot of her proposals, especially in regards to the 2A, but she hasn't lost her mind. If she changed her mind on the 2A, I could vote for her, not like the DNC would nominate her anyway A partial transcript is as follows: 

ANDERSON COOPER: We would like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us, what impact it had on you, and your beliefs.


REP. TULSI GABBARD: Where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know we greet each other with “aloha.” The challenge before us is our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership I seek to bring as president. Inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all. When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables, I see fellow Americans You can tell she's auditioning for a cabinet spot in the new Trump Administration. She’s still an evil piece of trash, I don’t care what she has to say. Tulsi has no genuine interest in securing the *Democratic* nomination. She's interested in providing a critique and pushing her not at all liberal policies Trump should really shake things up and ask her to be his 2020 running mate."

There's a difference between believing it's occurring and believing every doomsday theory ever. Thinking that the world will end in 12 years. There's a reason why conservatives tend to wave their hand at the topic, it's because they've already heard it 20 times.

Every prediction in Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth turned out to be false, and he won a Nobel Peace Prize for it. When I was growing up I was warned by teachers that urban areas would be unlivable due to acid rain, and that going outside would soon be impossible due to no ozone layer.

Every proposed solution seems to be in the realm of AOC's New Green Deal, anti-nuclear, ""we need socialism and by the way you need to give up all your freedom, also China will be the #1 economy now"". Or Bernie's 100 trillion dollar plan to replace all power in the United States with solar..... which... isn't necessarily even going to help the environment. What bothers me is that hydroelectric dams and nuclear power basically have zero carbon emissions, but everyone is pushing wind and solar that cost the most money to produce, so they require huge government subsidies or an enforced monopoly. When they only solution that will be considered is higher taxes and a central planned economy, I don't take you seriously. Here's what pisses me off the most. Environmental stewardship should be a top priority no mater where you land on the political spectrum, but both sides of the isle have been hijacked by political hacks who see this issue as a means of extracting money and power from the populace. There are real environmental problems that need solving, but the ""cause"" gets co-opted and corrupted by people who have political agendas that have little to do with solving the problems.

I could really go for some environmental solutions without all the social and economic engineering. I will never take people seriously who claim they have a unique understanding of science and then propose anti-scientific solutions. 

Wind and solar cannot save the environment. The jury is in on this. Whether it’s California, Ontario, or Germany, we’ve seen billions spent and the result has been the same. No, or minimal, reduction in emissions, huge increases to energy bills, and their own environmental crisis created by destroying habits, displacing native species, and the looming problem of what we’re going to do with tons and tons of heavy metal waste when these solar panels and turbines need to be replaced. 

I shouldn’t even need to get into how socialism has been thoroughly scientifically discredited, but rather use that as a segue into my real issue with all of this. Why is it that climate change seems to always come with the advancement of boutique left wing ideas that they’ve been trying to jam through the government for decades? The green new deal, for example, is a complete laundry list of radical leftists wet dreams. 

I could write you a “green new deal” that wouldn’t be longer than one page. For a very small fraction of the price of the GND, we could build nuclear power plants in China, India, Africa, and at home. Doing that alone would meet all targets and completely solve the supposed problem of putting too much plant food in the atmosphere. 

Why we never see these rational proposals I think should be clear. These supposed “environmentalists” don’t care nearly as much about carbon emissions as they do about cramming their personal politics down your throat. I just wish more Republicans would propose more reasonable solutions, instead of having to choose between socialism or doing nothing. It is amazing how we humans keep falling for apocalyptic predictions. Does anyone have a list of citations of these kinds of failed predictions? I mean, this stuff at least goes back to Malthus in 1798, with his concerns about ""overpopulation"" and food production not being able to keep up. The same goes for automation and various other ""crises"" which fluctuate in popularity but always use the same rhetoric, are based on the same fallacies and have the same political goals. This image is a perfect demonstration of why many people on the right don't believe climate change exists.

Yeah it exists, but when you scream your head about it being the end of the world over and over again, and the world keeps spinning just fine, people start to ignore the boy who cried wolf.

If you want people to be aware about climate change, be calm about it, present facts, and don't fear monger. Otherwise you'll just create a political divide.

Also, why doesn't anyone in politics ever propose a real solution? Like... hey, why not nuclear? Only the \*cleanest most efficient\* method of gathering energy we've ever invented.

I would happily support a ""green deal"" that actually proposed real viable solutions to the problem. Not this socialist dystopia bullcrap that constantly gets proposed by morons. How dare you! I laughed, but then felt bad when I thought about how many children's lives get ruined as they're used as a pawn for this sort of stuff. Sandmann, Hogg, Amari, now Greta. Adult opportunists willing to publicly manipulate/abuse children to make a point. I lived in Miami in 1977 when we got snow flurries. I remember being told this is what happened to the dinosaurs and i was terrified.... SHUT UP AND EAT THE BUGS The Great Hurricane of 1780 lasted roughly six days and is reported to have finished on October 16th.  It occurred in the Lesser Antilles region of the Atlantic, and killed around 25,000 people.   It is the dealiest Hurricane on record.

My favourite was cities were going to be over flowing in horse manure at the turn of the 20th century. Problem was fixed by the car.","Climate Change: A TimelineYes, yes, brigaders climate change is real, but the smug ""thE sCieNce iS seTtleD"" gets annoying. 

There's a difference between believing it's occurring and believing every doomsday theory ever. Thinking that the world will end in 12 years. There's a reason why conservatives tend to wave their hand at the topic, it's because they've already heard it 20 times.

Every prediction in Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth turned out to be false, and he won a Nobel Peace Prize for it. When I was growing up I was warned by teachers that urban areas would be unlivable due to acid rain, and that going outside would soon be impossible due to no ozone layer.

Every proposed solution seems to be in the realm of AOC's New Green Deal, anti-nuclear, ""we need socialism and by the way you need to give up all your freedom, also China will be the #1 economy now"". Or Bernie's 100 trillion dollar plan to replace all power in the United States with solar..... which... isn't necessarily even going to help the environment. What bothers me is that hydroelectric dams and nuclear power basically have zero carbon emissions, but everyone is pushing wind and solar that cost the most money to produce, so they require huge government subsidies or an enforced monopoly. When they only solution that will be considered is higher taxes and a central planned economy, I don't take you seriously. Here's what pisses me off the most. Environmental stewardship should be a top priority no mater where you land on the political spectrum, but both sides of the isle have been hijacked by political hacks who see this issue as a means of extracting money and power from the populace. There are real environmental problems that need solving, but the ""cause"" gets co-opted and corrupted by people who have political agendas that have little to do with solving the problems.

I could really go for some environmental solutions without all the social and economic engineering. I will never take people seriously who claim they have a unique understanding of science and then propose anti-scientific solutions. 

Wind and solar cannot save the environment. The jury is in on this. Whether it’s California, Ontario, or Germany, we’ve seen billions spent and the result has been the same. No, or minimal, reduction in emissions, huge increases to energy bills, and their own environmental crisis created by destroying habits, displacing native species, and the looming problem of what we’re going to do with tons and tons of heavy metal waste when these solar panels and turbines need to be replaced. 

I shouldn’t even need to get into how socialism has been thoroughly scientifically discredited, but rather use that as a segue into my real issue with all of this. Why is it that climate change seems to always come with the advancement of boutique left wing ideas that they’ve been trying to jam through the government for decades? The green new deal, for example, is a complete laundry list of radical leftists wet dreams. 

I could write you a “green new deal” that wouldn’t be longer than one page. For a very small fraction of the price of the GND, we could build nuclear power plants in China, India, Africa, and at home. Doing that alone would meet all targets and completely solve the supposed problem of putting too much plant food in the atmosphere. 

Why we never see these rational proposals I think should be clear. These supposed “environmentalists” don’t care nearly as much about carbon emissions as they do about cramming their personal politics down your throat. I just wish more Republicans would propose more reasonable solutions, instead of having to choose between socialism or doing nothing. It is amazing how we humans keep falling for apocalyptic predictions. Does anyone have a list of citations of these kinds of failed predictions? I mean, this stuff at least goes back to Malthus in 1798, with his concerns about ""overpopulation"" and food production not being able to keep up. The same goes for automation and various other ""crises"" which fluctuate in popularity but always use the same rhetoric, are based on the same fallacies and have the same political goals. This image is a perfect demonstration of why many people on the right don't believe climate change exists.

Yeah it exists, but when you scream your head about it being the end of the world over and over again, and the world keeps spinning just fine, people start to ignore the boy who cried wolf.

If you want people to be aware about climate change, be calm about it, present facts, and don't fear monger. Otherwise you'll just create a political divide.

Also, why doesn't anyone in politics ever propose a real solution? Like... hey, why not nuclear? Only the \*cleanest most efficient\* method of gathering energy we've ever invented.

I would happily support a ""green deal"" that actually proposed real viable solutions to the problem. Not this socialist dystopia bullcrap that constantly gets proposed by morons. How dare you! I laughed, but then felt bad when I thought about how many children's lives get ruined as they're used as a pawn for this sort of stuff. Sandmann, Hogg, Amari, now Greta. Adult opportunists willing to publicly manipulate/abuse children to make a point. I lived in Miami in 1977 when we got snow flurries. I remember being told this is what happened to the dinosaurs and i was terrified.... SHUT UP AND EAT THE BUGS The Great Hurricane of 1780 lasted roughly six days and is reported to have finished on October 16th.  It occurred in the Lesser Antilles region of the Atlantic, and killed around 25,000 people.   It is the dealiest Hurricane on record.

Who could have thought?!?",Conservative,the_perfect_drug_,t5_2qh6p,dinui1,"Next you'll be telling me that increasing the supply of unskilled labor through a flood of illegals reduces the price of unskilled labor. As if there were some sort of relationship between supply and demand. Evidence that our public education system has been failing us for more than a generation now.  Half of the country looks at Target....and blames Target.  A scant understanding of very basic economics would have stopped this madness. Wages go up, hours go down, net pay goes down... This is a familiar story (Bernie Sanders). And when hours get cut, workers fall below the 30 hour cutoff for healthcare benefits. Now Target certainly isn't struggling financially, but this is a multinational company and they're cutting hours. Imagine how this will impact family-run businesses... Which is a huge portion of the economy. 

The problem isn't a $15 wage, the problem is a $15 minimum artificially inflated wage. Some people are worth $15/hr, that's what I pay one of my employees who has 20+ years of experience AND she gets commission, and cost of living where I live isn't like Boston or NYC. Maybe some green employees are worth that in expensive cities. But without a specific skill-set, most folks aren't worth that much, not without experience.

Ultimately the road to hell (and suffering) is paved with good intentions. This is just another example of how liberal policy and agenda is conflated with compassion. There is nothing compassionate about: 
1) artificially raising wages so prices go up and net pay goes down.
2) letting illegal immigrants come into the country while they remain a permanent underclass of ""not citizens"" but not taxpayers - where they aren't protected by labor laws and work in the underground economy. 
3) letting biological men play in women's sports.
4) telling children they can be whatever gender they want.
5) traumatizing children into thinking the world is ending from climate change.
6) taking law-abiding citizens guns away when there are more serious public health problems like heart disease, drug addiction, and endemic fatherlessness. 
7) forcing doctors to accept government insurance that won't pay them a market rate. 
8) letting the homeless (usually mentally ill and drug addicted) sleep in the streets. 

I could go on but I need to get to work. One of these days, some of these people will realize that we're not just making this shit up. The minimum wage is, and always will be, $0. Socialist Democrats don’t really care. For them, that’s an even better reason to institute UBI. Increased minimum wage is not the end game. Nope not surprising at all and at least Target is doing well and they can help offset the increase in labor costs via self checkouts.  

But that's not the story for a lot of other businesses.  What about the ones that aren't in a strong financial position and require all their workers to be there for their full time hours by the very nature of the work?

They have to cut somewhere and if they can't raise prices for the consumer because the market won't handle it, then they fold.  Imagine if this was mandatory for small businesses. What?! Its almost as if the minimum wage was kept low to offer easy employment to younger inexperienced people! I understand the OP but there are people working full-time at places like Walmart who need to subsidise their income with food stamps

I don't care which way you lean politically...that should NEVER happen

>The ""betrayal"" by the United states on their Kurdish allies was not expected, but it had to happen sooner or later considering the relationship between the two NATO allies(US and Turkey) in the past few years

Non sequitur, makes no sense. How can it both be unexpected, yet bound to happen sooner or later? 

>Last Friday/ 11nth of October. Turkish artillery strike landed 300m off a US commando outpost. Turkish military being part of NATO would have precisely known the location of the US military bases along the Turkish border. Also these US military bases would be marked as NFA - ""No fire areas"".

Either cops or the new ""criminals"". Even if we take the 30k deaths due to guns as gospel, that's 33 years worth of deaths. Confiscation is not about saving lives. At all.

I also think more than 1% will resist. Larry Correia wrote an awesome essay last year that I think would encompass this conversation.  Some of my favorite quotes from it are:

* I’ve had a Caring Liberal tell me that the example of Iraq doesn’t  apply, because “we kept the gloves on”, whereas fighting America’s gun  nuts would be a righteous total war with nothing held back… Holy shit,  I’ve got to wonder about the mentality of people who demand rigorous ROEs to prevent civilian casualties in a foreign country, are blood  thirsty enough to carpet bomb Texas. 
*  A friend of mine who is a political activist said something interesting  the other day, and that was for most people on the left political  violence is a knob, and they can turn the heat up and down, with things  like protests, and riots, all the way up to destruction of property, and  sometimes murder… But for the vast majority of folks on the right, it’s  an off and on switch. And the settings are Vote or Shoot Fucking  Everybody.  And believe me, you really don’t want that switch to get  flipped, because Civil War 2.0 would make Bosnia look like a trip to Disneyworld. 
*  To pull off confiscation now you’d have to be willing to kill millions  of people. The congressman’s suggestion was incredibly stupid, but it  was nice to see one of you guys being honest about it for once.  In  order to maybe, hypothetically save thousands, you’d be willing to  slaughter millions. Either you really suck at math, or the ugly truth is  that you just hate the other side so much that you think killing  millions of people is worth it to make them fall in line. And if that’s  the case, you’re a sick bastard, and a great example of why the rest of  us aren’t ever going to give up our guns.

It’s entirely irrational and unreasonable to expect a historical figure like Augustus Caesar to have envisioned and adopted today’s standards, especially considering today’s standards are themselves all but guaranteed to be considered barbaric by future generations. >It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sumbitch or another. It's called the Whig Fallacy of History or Presentism, and it's an elementary-level fuck up in the historical community It's interesting to hear Walsh make this argument.

From a theological perspective, moral standards don't change with time so it wouldn't be wrong to hold a person from any time up to that standard. The issue, rather, is that what passes as a ""modern standard"" in every generation doesn't actually match God's standard.

If we apply God's standard, every historical figure save Christ has failed to measure up, and so does our modern standards and everyone alive today. The failure of people to understand this is why we live in such a graceless society. Don't down vote the counter argument into Oblivion.  We are better than that guys...  Instead, just respond with logically sound and respectful counter arguments. I don't agree. Owning people is wrong. Infidelity is wrong. Just because your current society doesn't mind, doesn't make it right. Just like killing your own offspring in the womb and sexualizing children is wrong. Yet our current year society embraces it.

Amazing how CNN's narrative the first few debates were on how well the Progressives did, when they didn't, and now it's how the ""Moderates fight back"", when it wasn't anymore than the past debates. Wish Delaney was in this debate. Big things missing: China and Hong Kong The debate, as I saw it:

- More Supreme Court justices.


- No guns.

Steyer Businessman 07:12 Biden showed up in true form to the Dementia-crat debate! I had my record player on in honor of the gaffe machine himself 😂 Subject by subject:

HC: Same old story, although Warrens campaign will have to call in the doctor for the bloody nose she got over her plan and not giving a straight yes or no on taxes rising.

Impeachment: All in favor, yet some admitted it might not happen. Still the fact that they are doing domestically what they accuse Trump of doing internationally is as bad and just as shameful considering there’s a brace of Senators on stage.

Immigration: What immigration? Why tackle the tough issue. 

Economy: What the flying hell. Expand unions? What is this, Britain circa 1923? What realm of fantasy are they living in exactly? Also as nice as it all sounds, not one of them backed Trumps tariffs yet keep slamming corporations without a direct means to punish them for doing business in China. It’s the typical all talk crap. Also expecting Mexico to implement a minimum wage close to ours on trade deals is farcical. 

Foreign Affairs: let me tell you what a pipe dream is, firstly, Syria may look disgraceful on the face of it, here’s key facts missing, there’s two rapid reaction units that are 3 to 5 times larger than our 1,000 spec ops troops in Syria, Britain’s 16 Air Assault Brigade and Germany’s 9th Panzer Lehr Brigade, neither were mentioned, no demand for any ally to help out. If our 1,000 was holding back 100,000. We might as well dispense with the rest of the Army and just have SOCOM. Also Turkeys membership in NATO was brought up, much to my shock only two debate members flat out said they shouldn’t be members. Those two things and still blaming Trump for abandoning the Kurds when Kurdistan is a 30 year old fantasy. That’s a pipe dream. Hong Kong? Never mind China has a large nuclear arsenal and a military with enough bodies available to walk from China to Japan to Alaska without getting their feet wet, but the damn city isn’t up for sale and at least the President hasn’t said fuck em like the NBA. That’s a pipe dream.

2nd Amendment: Beto failed this spectacularly, he couldn’t answer the question and AR-47? Really. They all failed this, with an Assault Weapons Ban that didn’t work the last time it passed. I’ll do you one better than this, if you wouldn’t ban the M1 Garand, which can do awful things, why even waste our time with the AR-15. 

Defense: Again, why tackle the tough issues, no mention of the 10 CVN limit, no mention of how to cope with greatly increased commitments based on their politics of emotion over fact and logic. No mention of developing the ABMs we need to have available at even the tactical level to be able to engage or attack nations like China over Hong Kong, or potentially Russia over Turkey/Syria. What about the size of the Army? Are we gonna depend on SOCOM solely? Why no genuine deployment of a division or a full Corp to the area as a counter to Trumps policy? I could be honest and say Democrats wouldn’t support it, but even I won’t be that obvious. 

Let me know about any other issue I missed! #Verdict: **Democrats still cray** [deleted] Didn’t see a clear winner from the front runners. EW took some shots from Amy but nothing too major. Tulsi was good but the left can’t stand her. The question is, if Warren gets the nod (H2.O) who does she pick as a running mate. 

I got 1/2 way through then put it in in the background - way to painful. It is the people who work hard and succeed that are the problem, we need to work to the least common denominator.  And yes, people who have never worked in their lives, other than living off the system can fix all the problems, just give them 90% of your earnings and all will be good.

Zuckerberg,  Bezos, Buffett, Gates, guys, it is all your fault for creating companies that employ people, just give them money... 

Just too painful... - Biden and Warren running with the platform of ""Orange man bad!"" and nothing else very significant.

- Sanders talking about his free stuff pledges while ignoring increasing taxes to accomplish this.

- Harris sounds like a dictator in how she demands Trump to be booted off Twitter for having opinions she doesn't like.

- Don't remember much from Yang, Booker, and Buttigeig.

- Klobuchar sounds like she's about to cry when she talks.

- O'Rourke proves he is a fool if he thinks gun owners will simply just ""comply with the law"" when it comes to assault rifle bans.

- Gabbard was pretty much shoved off to the side. I had two main takeaways: 

1) It is abundantly clear that we need a new debate format. The issue is no candidate would subject themselves to a debate format that would inform the public, and the public is too passive to demand a thorough examination of the candidates--which is exactly why we havent felt good about a competent presidential candidate in who knows how long. How do we go through an entire debate to see who is going to compete for the presidency without a SINGLE question about China, our biggest geopolitical foe? In the midst of a controversy where their Government is trying to censor American business and free speech?

2) The Dems only shot at being Trump is if Hillary comes out during the DNC. These guys are a bunch jokes. Biden is a zombie. Warren doesnt have an original thought. Harris is a hypocrite. Yang isn't dumb but they've decided they don't like him for whatever reason. Mayor Pete looks like he's 20 and wouldn't win his own town in a general. One of the most startling and bizarre things to me was Democratic candidate after candidate saying they should ""hold pharma execs accountable"".  For what? What laws were broken?  Do they not believe in the rule of law any more? What the hell is going on? Warren is going to be seen as Hillary 2.0 if she is elected.Warren has been doubling down on social issues and pissing off the actual far left. Biden would be  a reverse Romney  as he pretended to be more socially liberal than he actually is. 

There is no genuine moderate this time like Jim Webb as SJW capitalists like Hillary, Seyer aren't genuine centrists. The Democrats have two options a far leftist like Sanders who focuses on class(which won't happen because of their donors) and SJW capitalists who focus on race. That last question proved beyond a doubt what a disgusting RINO McCain was I genuinely disagree with a lot of her policies. Tulsi though, she just gets to the point, puts out the message, and actually comes off as a true leader with a positive and inspiring message. The left seems to not want anything to do with that. I'd have no hesitation in fighting for her and again, while I disagree with her policies, she really seems like a solid leader. I said this at the end of the last debate. Warren is going to get it. 100%.

This might be a softball for Trump. Funniest was how they all pointed out that McCain was such an asshole that it is surprising anyone was a friend. Did not watch it - I now have popcorn for the fallout. Why is every post on here so heavily downvoted? Didn’t watch the full debate because postseason baseball.  Did Biden’s son saying he won’t do any deals with foreign companies if his dad is elected come up at all? Just curious. So many loaded and bias questions from CNN Most of them sound like Robin Hood when asked how they'd pay for all the free stuff, but then you remember they're politicians so they will take theirs off the top. 
I was overall disappointed at the softball questions given to the candidates and how they didn't hold anyone to giving legit answers. 

If I was forced to vote for any of them I guess Klobuchar and Gabbard were the closest to being ""moderate"", though even then I'd try not to vote as they are not nearly conservative enough.


Honestly though, they just reinforced how glad I am Trump is currently in office. None of them could beat Trump, period.
The dems will have to try to impeach for another 4 years....it will break their party in 2 and I will be loving every minute of it. You mean that people actually WATCHED the Dims debate? Leading questions from CNN/NYT. Expected that.

Buttigieg had a good debate, pulling of a pivot to moderation and positioning himself as the go-to when Biden collapses for the moderates.

Fauchohontas was terrible, more terrible than usual, and Buttigieg pointed out her evasiveness for major points. She promises everything to everyone, has no sane funding mechanism, and comes off as naïve idealist not worthy of the office. Where Bernie is sincere and deluded about socialism, Fauxchohontas is evasive and deluded about socialism. I am not surprised the other glassy eyed socialists in the Democratic party are lining up behind Bernie now.

Beto was terrible as usual, still going for some wild Hail Mary to get any kind of share of the public. He was the guy who brought us AR-15 confiscation and removal of charitable status from churches that do not comply with government dictates on ideology. With luck he will not be on the next stage.

Bernie comes off as the sincere ideologue who rails against the injustice of the prosperity for all in the Trump economy. It feels like he is using the same recycled message long after the situation on the board has changed. He did not look like he was going to collapse at any moment due to heart failure, so I suppose that was a plus.

Harris is an inconsequential nothingburger of slogans. I do not see her gaining ground. I see bored eyes wandering elsewhere.

Yang is a wonk wedded to the crap idea of UBI. He does not play it up as a replacement scheme for existing welfare and the like, a net efficiency increase. No, it comes off as an entitlement handout to likely Democrats. I think he will hold for a while in the upper half of the field as it will take a bit longer to dismantle why UBI is such a garbage idea.

Booker was annoying and sanctimonious, calling for harmony in a debate where one should see real distinctions between candidates. He is spinning badly and I do not think he will be with us much longer.

I did not see a lot of Caestro in the hour or so I watched, but what I did see showed him once again to be the liar on stage with a salsa flair to his lies. I suppose if you do not like bland paleface liars like Warren, then perhaps a spicy Caestro liar would be a good alternative.

Klobuchar is in the middle moderate lane, but was visibly quaking. Not sure what was going on there. She did not have the ease or confidence of Buttigieg. Her points were good and might read well in the transcript, but to the eye she was not holding her ground.

Biden was as Vince/WMAL describes it 'word salad' with a bunch of incoherent phrases mashed up into a word jumble that goes nowhere. Health concerns with Joe are real here, and I think the other candidates see it, and are positioning accordingly. He failed at the one question he knew he was going to get with his son Hunter. He also over used 'let's focus on the real problem here, Trump' so much that the redirection tactic failed horribly and only left me with the impression he was being evasive with so much to hide.

I had no impression about Steyer. The Bernie supporter in the cube next to me thought it was a little rich that the billionaire was talking about things like income inequality. Not sure his buy in is going to pay off in the poker game of the Democratic primaries.

Gabbard was avoided by the garbage NYT/CNN moderators as expected. Her tone was softer, but her points showed some flashes of mental clarity. She was in the background this time, but still falls in the top 3 least disgusting Democratic primary candidates. across the board the Dems seem to think that Trump himself is the problem and not just a symptom of something bigger and more insidious. This just goes to show that none of them (except for maybe Tulsi) is looking to fix America, they’re just looking to beat Trump and get in office. They are just as ugly as he is, only he’s more open about it. Really impressed with Buttigieg tonight.

428,"I'll definitely take the old masculinity over GQ's ""New Masculinity""",Conservative,Sola__Fide,t5_2qh6p,dij3hg,"When you go on a camping trip and get stuck in your sleeping bag. ""Wow, this is trendy!"" That just femininity with extra steps I mean, what do you expect them to do though? Who do you think buys GQ?  Does anyone here actually buy this crap? You can't reform masculinity into femininity. It's literally the other side of the coin. It seem like another attempt to shame men for being masculine, but dressing him in a giant yellow sleeping bag doesn't give it any cred, he just looks a fool. They tried to kill masculinity but they couldn't so they tried to redefine it. They couldn't. Masculinity looks an awful lot like a princess of Zamunda... What the hell is that? Yea this is just shit rich artists make up because they are insane. 

I like Pharrell. I have for decades. I think he's masculine. But it's not a new level of masculinity. John Waters is a thing that happened a long, long time ago. Plus, Pharrell was just a normal dude when he came on the scene. Now he's a multi-millionaire playboy. He's not the face of anything aside from 1/artistry and 2/insanity. Fuck GQ.

PS: I would be 100% wearing a parka of the Green Bay Packers just for the hell of it if I were in his shoes. Lol wtf is that? Tell me this is a parody...  Please.... This reminds me of James Bond's inflatable coat from The World is Not Enough which he used to survive an avalanche. Masculine men are always desirable. This is not. It’s weird. Idk man that looks pretty comfy Why is he wearing a sleeping bag that can fit a family? Snuggie: Sleeping Bag edition My wife is going to be pisssssssed when she found out I cut a hole in our down comforter. WHAT. THE. FUCK. Wearing a sleeping bag is masculine. ... K? Orwell would be proud. As a woman I'll take old masculinity everyday. Hahahahaha. Mabye it just his sleeping bag🤷‍♂️ 
Camping is manly right!? 😂 I thought those were breadsticks at first. He looks like a lampshade Someone should tell Chris Tucker they are copying his Ruby Rhod look from The Fith Element:

Apparently the writers of **The Office** predicted this in [the first season](http://www.officequotes.net/no1-06.php) way back in 2005:


>Dwight: I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.

This is to make the basement dwellers more comfortable. Letting close define your masculinity is not maaculinity I just don't understand why anyone would be concerned. This being has clearly evolved over the rest of us. so, in order to be a man you must first become a squid

It looks like he got tangled up in his comforter and thought to himself, while he looked into his mirrored ceiling, ""this would make such a manly photoshoot."" I'm not sure if anyone has ever been more wrong. These styles are so copycat.

Lmao what am I looking at I think they misspelled “regular old effeminacy”. Is he homeless now? Why is he wearing his sleeping bag? History is filled with the sound of silken slippers going downstairs and wooden shoes coming up.

-Voltaire Bro what... is this shit even real?

Bring in the clown world memes, if so! Only men can define masculinity. 

So not sure that magazine qualifies After three generations of fatherlessness this is what you get. Wtf is this idiot wearing... Hollyweird and their nonsense He is a quiltmas tree. Eh. Still too white. Any man cares this much about fashion is not a man. Russell Westbrook, and cam newton are weird as fuck too me. [deleted]","I'll definitely take the old masculinity over GQ's ""New Masculinity""When you go on a camping trip and get stuck in your sleeping bag. ""Wow, this is trendy!"" That just femininity with extra steps I mean, what do you expect them to do though? Who do you think buys GQ?  Does anyone here actually buy this crap? You can't reform masculinity into femininity. It's literally the other side of the coin. It seem like another attempt to shame men for being masculine, but dressing him in a giant yellow sleeping bag doesn't give it any cred, he just looks a fool. They tried to kill masculinity but they couldn't so they tried to redefine it. They couldn't. Masculinity looks an awful lot like a princess of Zamunda... What the hell is that? Yea this is just shit rich artists make up because they are insane. 

I like Pharrell. I have for decades. I think he's masculine. But it's not a new level of masculinity. John Waters is a thing that happened a long, long time ago. Plus, Pharrell was just a normal dude when he came on the scene. Now he's a multi-millionaire playboy. He's not the face of anything aside from 1/artistry and 2/insanity. Fuck GQ.

PS: I would be 100% wearing a parka of the Green Bay Packers just for the hell of it if I were in his shoes. Lol wtf is that? Tell me this is a parody...  Please.... This reminds me of James Bond's inflatable coat from The World is Not Enough which he used to survive an avalanche. Masculine men are always desirable. This is not. It’s weird. Idk man that looks pretty comfy Why is he wearing a sleeping bag that can fit a family? Snuggie: Sleeping Bag edition My wife is going to be pisssssssed when she found out I cut a hole in our down comforter. WHAT. THE. FUCK. Wearing a sleeping bag is masculine. ... K? Orwell would be proud. As a woman I'll take old masculinity everyday. Hahahahaha. Mabye it just his sleeping bag🤷‍♂️ 
Camping is manly right!? 😂 I thought those were breadsticks at first. He looks like a lampshade Someone should tell Chris Tucker they are copying his Ruby Rhod look from The Fith Element:

Apparently the writers of **The Office** predicted this in [the first season](http://www.officequotes.net/no1-06.php) way back in 2005:


>Dwight: I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.

>Jim: Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?

>Dwight: No.

>Jim: Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them. Reminds me of the 'Caridad del Cobre' representation of Mary.

This is to make the basement dwellers more comfortable. Letting close define your masculinity is not maaculinity I just don't understand why anyone would be concerned. This being has clearly evolved over the rest of us. so, in order to be a man you must first become a squid

The only thing that could sink Trump is a dramatic change in the economy - which is a possible but  unlikely possibility between now and 2020. Short of that, neither Biden nor Warren have the staying power.

Keep an eye on the economy, that'll set the stage for the next election. Dont get comfortable or cocky, still need to support, campaign,  and turn out to vote. This is why it is not being reported - demoralize the base if possible.

That is a very childlike view.  

I view government almost as a necessary evil.  It should protect our rights and liberties, punish criminals, and defend the nation.  The less influence the government has in my life, the better.

493,19% of Democrat Debate Watchers Have Switched Candidates,Conservative,fudwicker,t5_2qh6p,difiee,"I see a lot of whining about wanting to break up big Corps, banks, making them pay super high taxes. Climate change, taxing the rich, which actually means taxing the middle class. Healthcare and free college for all with no way to realistically pay for it. Open borders which means American citizens loose job opportunities, firearms restrictions, or flat out bans that violate our freedoms. Major regulations on the environment, meaning job and economic contraction. All the Democrats offer is to take a wrecking ball to the country and turn it into a giant welfare ponzi scheme. This type of economics is not sustainable. In reality these candidates don't really offer Americans anything. I'm going to increase your taxes and regulate the hell out of everything, so vote for me. Naw, no thanks Socialist Democrats. If I had ever been a Democrat, after watching those debates I would have switched to Trump. To be fair, the same happened 4 years ago when there were a butt load of GOP candidates too. Until they back out and dwindle down to a few of the final candidates after some of the primaries, people's idea of who is the ""best"" will change as they debate and run their campaign. It's the natural progression of campaigns.
Personally, anyone who locks into a candidate from day 1 is often the person who is voting for something other a candidate's stance on issues or their debates.

Democrats should change their mascot to the banana. So, I have a question... I was hoping somebody could shed light on. Can the democrats put forth articles of impeachment while simultaneously preventing republicans from having the right to subpoena? 

From what I understand, formal impeachment proceedings mean that the House Judiciary Committee conducts an investigation and a bi-partisan investigation is conducted with both republicans and democrats being given the right to subpoena. However, currently the current ‘investigation committee’ which consists of Nadler and his goon squad and is not the actual house judiciary committee is “investigating” and putting forth subpoenas against WH officials with approval from congress which is dem majority.

It seems to me (again, somebody please enlighten me) that dems will just have their witch hunt committee “investigate” then put forth articles of impeachment utilizing those findings.

Am I correct or does Pelosi have to hold a formal vote and allow a bi-partisan investigation via the HJC in order to vote on articles of impeachment? This is their plan.  They'll continue this til a little before the 2020 election.  Then they'll deliver impeachment such that the senate will not have enough time to not find a conviction (because they won't).  But the Dems will then bank on the American public being stupid and perceive Trump as guilty since he was officially impeached by the house.  They'll pair this up with campaign adds to this effect and the left-biased media will back them.

We'll have to hope the American people are not collectively too stupid to fall for this. Dems change house rules again; The President is to be considered guilty because he says mean things and stuff.

Seriously, holy shit.....nobody is above the Law, but if the President is *below* the law, then we will never have another President that isn't forever under impeachment proceedings until there really is a civil war.  Do the Dems think that this *won't* come back to haunt them the next time a Dem gets elected?

Lots of young democrats hate Joe Biden because he is seen as less liberal, and during this campaign has aligned himself as a ""centrist"". Do conservatives dislike Joe Biden as well, and do they dislike him as strongly as the other democratic candidates? If Trump does not win reelection and a democrat is president, China would much rather see Biden win the democrats over Warren since he will negotiate better trade. Do conservatives agree with liberal view of Joe Biden being a ""centrist"", or would most conservatives still say that Biden is left leaning? who’s most likely to drop out next? I honestly don't even feel like watching. My vote is already locked in for Trump and every single R down the line.  The only thing I have left to do is look at the primaries in my state for Senate. My representative is going to a Democrat though even after I vote for whatever R they put up.

The last few debates have only increased my blood pressure at how outrageous they are. I think after the fallout with Biden the nomination is going to Warren unless Clinton really does step back in (LOL) 7PM CDT happens when this comment is 3 hours and 35 minutes old.

Organized by Mexico’s National Front for Family (FNF), the march was active not only in Mexico City, but in 100 other cities and towns across the country.

>A declaration was read in the cities where marchers were on the move that said: “Mexico doesn’t need more of the culture of death. All of us must work not only to stop the madness of organized crime, in all of its facets, but also build an authentic culture of life.” It went on to say, “For this to happen, it is necessary to start with the family, the basic cell of society, in which life is not only created, but where it must be welcomed and cared for throughout its life cycle and continuously strengthened through a good education.”

>The document called on the Mexican government to uphold the rights of all citizens, “starting with the most vulnerable Mexicans. If we cannot guarantee life, we certainly cannot do so for the rest of basic values.” The declaration rejected all forms of the “legal or tolerated criminal violence, such as prenatal murder, and illegal criminality such as extortion, kidnapping and murder of thousands of people who are members of millions of families.”

543,But that wasn’t “real” socialism!,Conservative,the-overm1nd,t5_2qh6p,dibqp6,"Wow this is the first spooktober meme I’ve seen in a while They always call it ""Democratic Socialism"". Always. Grim Reaper: Ah shit, it's that time of the century again. Now this is dank. Have you seen socialists try to pin more deaths on Capitalism? It's impressive to watch their mental gymnastics. Didn't think it was real. But explore Reddit a bit and you will see socialists everywhere. I frequent the UK politics sub and libertarian sub, both have a lot of socialist. They try and tell you how it will solve all the problems, solve the environment, poverty, everything. 

They never can answer me when they say it will stop pollution when I ask what happens when millions of people suddenly get access to the capital to go on vacations or buy more. They just say consumerism is a issue of capitalism, and people will magically stop wanting it when it's under socialism. 

So your telling me, if I assume your plan magically works and everyone lives in a classless society, they will not want things? They will not want better food? Vacations? Travel? Yeah right. the ""it isn't real socialism"" is the most widespread, perfect example of the no true scotsman fallacy. Is this posted in r/politicalhumor yet? Well regressive ideology has only successful done one thing.
Too bad that one thing is marketing. I mean your people have never experienced it, but the fact that there are still communists in Russia just proves that people don’t learn 200M?  I thought it was at most around 100 million, probably closer to 90 million.

Still horrific numbers when compared to any other evil ideology, like the rat bastard nazis. I used this picture for the cover photo of my Halloween party....just thought I’d add that. I have had so many conversations that are exactly this.

When pointing out that one can also say that Nazism was not real Nazism, etc. they freak out. They think that just cause Marx was not head of state of the soviet union, or any commie country, there never was ""real communism"". Well, since Marx is not longer on this world, by their argument, there can never be real communism anymore. Ever. That is where, I think, most commies get a bit... miffed. Let's pretend that the 15 billion dollar bailout for farmers caught in the trade war isn't socialism, or the various subsidies for agricultural or industrial concerns.

At the surface this means nothing, but in reality, it means that the connection between AntifFa and the Democrats is at least 10x as nefarious as it would be if AntiFa actually legitimately believed in the anarcho-communist cause. It means that AntiFa - not just the leadership; but the low-level goons as well - are just a bunch of  assets committing terrorism. It has to work this time, right?

This is why education is so important.  It's also why movies, TV, and Video games are important. Tbf, it's never been tried in the US, the greatest country in the world. Thanks to Capitalism. They'll get it right. Don't fret! /s So you don’t want any socialistic policies? No Medicare? No food stamps? No social security? What does ""real socialism"" mean?  Everyone has the same exact wealth?  Not sure I've seen any candidate push that nonsense.  

We already have plenty of socialist programs in the USA don't we?  Nothing to be scared of.....just don't take it too far like anything else. “It was implemented incorrectly” “it’s not real socialism”","But that wasn’t “real” socialism!Wow this is the first spooktober meme I’ve seen in a while They always call it ""Democratic Socialism"". Always. Grim Reaper: Ah shit, it's that time of the century again. Now this is dank. Have you seen socialists try to pin more deaths on Capitalism? It's impressive to watch their mental gymnastics. Didn't think it was real. But explore Reddit a bit and you will see socialists everywhere. I frequent the UK politics sub and libertarian sub, both have a lot of socialist. They try and tell you how it will solve all the problems, solve the environment, poverty, everything. 

They never can answer me when they say it will stop pollution when I ask what happens when millions of people suddenly get access to the capital to go on vacations or buy more. They just say consumerism is a issue of capitalism, and people will magically stop wanting it when it's under socialism. 

So your telling me, if I assume your plan magically works and everyone lives in a classless society, they will not want things? They will not want better food? Vacations? Travel? Yeah right. the ""it isn't real socialism"" is the most widespread, perfect example of the no true scotsman fallacy. Is this posted in r/politicalhumor yet? Well regressive ideology has only successful done one thing.
Too bad that one thing is marketing. I mean your people have never experienced it, but the fact that there are still communists in Russia just proves that people don’t learn 200M?  I thought it was at most around 100 million, probably closer to 90 million.

Still horrific numbers when compared to any other evil ideology, like the rat bastard nazis. I used this picture for the cover photo of my Halloween party....just thought I’d add that. I have had so many conversations that are exactly this.

When pointing out that one can also say that Nazism was not real Nazism, etc. they freak out. They think that just cause Marx was not head of state of the soviet union, or any commie country, there never was ""real communism"". Well, since Marx is not longer on this world, by their argument, there can never be real communism anymore. Ever. That is where, I think, most commies get a bit... miffed. Let's pretend that the 15 billion dollar bailout for farmers caught in the trade war isn't socialism, or the various subsidies for agricultural or industrial concerns. GM or Boeing getting government subsidies up to 64 billion, and bailing out Wall Street. Socialism seems only to be allowed where elected officials can personally benefit.

599,"Woman Pays $10,000 to Have Her 32-Week-Old Unborn Baby Aborted",Conservative,DanAdamsShow,t5_2qh6p,di8gtp,"Not a ""true conservative"" on the issue of abortion,   so this might be the wrong place to post this,  but I'm interested in a discussion.

I've gone back and forth on late term abortion because babies born at 32 weeks are definitely viable.  But in cases like these...

The baby couldn't breathe.  It would have died the minute the umbilical cord was cut. From this lady's viewpoint, she's already grieving the loss of her child, now she has to carry the living corpse every day for a month.  I can't imagine how devastating that must be. Some women may have the mental fortitude to go through something like this, but not all. We don't know her, so do we, as outsiders,  have the right to condemn her actions?

Disclosure: I'm anti abortion but pro choice,  if that makes sense. I think we need to do everything we can to deal with the reasons why women seek abortions -- better community support for children with disabilities,  make it easier for young mothers to succeed at college,  etc. -- but I'm uncomfortable with a blanket law that doesn't take an individual's circumstances into account. This is incredibly disturbing. My baby was born premature at 34 weeks and was healthy and only had jaundice. I can’t imagine a fully developed baby being murdered. My niece carried twins, and they knew there was problems with them from about 20 weeks. She chose to give birth to them at 32 weeks. One died immediately and the other died three hours later. They were able to hold them and say goodbye. I so admire her for willing to carry her babies, knowing they wouldn’t have a chance.

This is just sad. She should have her ovaries removed at the same time To be honest I don't know if I'd have the strength for dealing with what she was told.  It's something I wouldn't wish on anyone.  That said, as someone mentioned her ovaries should be a removed... may be that should be a condition if you have choose to abort.  Not that I support abortion, but the baby was dealt shit cards because of genetic failings passed from the parents.","Woman Pays $10,000 to Have Her 32-Week-Old Unborn Baby AbortedNot a ""true conservative"" on the issue of abortion,   so this might be the wrong place to post this,  but I'm interested in a discussion.

Its still good news and a historic moment nonetheless. Was this meant to be posted in r/conservation? Well no shit. Trump signed the largest wildlife conservation act in American history history"

This entire thing is nonsense. They’re making a mockery of US politics and should all be forced to quit. They’d find a new job soon enough with Cirque du Soleil. Meanwhile, Jonah Goldberg has posted several tweets quoting this story and making snide remarks about Trump in the process.

I don’t know what happened to the guy. He’s become such an unbelievable hack.

He’s gone from being a rational Trump skeptic to being a full-blown TDS’er in the same vein as Jen Rubin and Evan McMuffin.

Jonah Goldberg and David French simply aren’t conservatives anymore. No matter how much they claim to be, the fact that they willfully jump headfirst on every Adam Schiff hoax, they fall for every Democrat talking point, and they always believe every anti-Trump scandal - no matter how little evidence there may be - means they have zero credibility. They’re left wing hacks. If they need a third whistleblower, I've never been to the Whitehouse, never seen President Trump, know nothing about any calls, but it troubles me that he has the OPPORTUNITY to even make calls, so he needs to be IN-PEACH-ED.

 #clownworld So if she wasn't even working in the White House, how did she find out about the contents of the call?

Remember, they were classified and stored on a secure server.  Even if she had the appropriate security clearance level to see it, she still had to have need to know - which pretty much nobody outside that room did. This is the second witness that wasn't even around when the call was made. It only enforces my suspicion that Schiff has nothing, and is just trying to pad opinion in the democrats favor. 

But if this ever does go to the floor for a vote, and the public gets to actually see the super secret testimony, people will still be asking "" what exactly are you claiming the president did wrong?"". Holy shit, it's The Waif from Game of Thrones. Translation: I remember him standing by the red solo cups. What a hack article.

> The liberal media pushed the line all day that she was a very important Russia adviser — they really propped her up. This can only mean that they know she is an anti-Trump hack.

Later tonight Democrats leaked out that Fiona Hill was “very disturbed” about the Trump phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.

I don't think it's being claimed that she had personal knowledge of the call itself, but the larger situation about efforts ""[to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/bolton-giuliani-fiona-hill-testimony.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)"": apparently she ""testified that Mr. Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. Sondland, Mr. Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff"".

🤡🌎 Obviously the call was only one moment in a long period of illegally pressuring Ukraine to make negative statements about Trumps political enemies. Fiona hill was involved with this process well before the famous call happened, back before the current Ukrainian president was elected.

They are not going to agree to a trade deal until Trump wins 2020. Or the people who where up in arms that trump is a total warmonger/dictator and shouldn't be given the nuclear codes are now upset about leaving Syria.

honk. Lately liberals are like a limp sock on a stick... blow whichever way the fake news hot air blows. What really annoys me is the people who are saying tariffs make things more expensive and hurt the economy, are the same ones saying ""we need to raise taxes"".

In case anyone is not aware, tariffs only hurt the economy because they are a tax. The only difference is, the mostly hurt China, whereas any other tax only hurts the US. I used to be against the tarrifs, now I think we need an embargo. We don't trade with Cuba because of how they treat their people. We didn't trade with the USSR. We need to not trade with China. They’re definitely not the ones angry about Blizzard and NBA players cucking to China’s communist party I admit, I'm anti-tariff, myself, but some people are anti-Trump, so he can't win, and they're blind to their own hypocrisy.

(I'm now doubting myself now that I type this, but ) Maybe the tariffs would have been received, at least, by the moderates if President Trump had touted them as a way to reduce Chinese influence, rather than a way to punish the Chinese for bad behavior. 

Personally, even being anti-tariff, I would willingly swallow higher prices if they were geared to reduce Chinese influence. Bonus points if Trump got other countries to do it as well. Trade restrictions because they are in the best interest of the US Economy?  Evil capitalism. 


Trade restrictions because you are mad about the other country's human rights records?  Pure gold. I think in general tariffs are bad policy. We should be advocating for more trading between us and China, not less. Especially because ~90% of our stuff is from there. More Capitalism = better. This is teed up for Trump.  If he can just improve his messaging and get out there direct to the public to tell them this it would go a long way. They cant let their shiny $1000 iPhones cost $1100 instead. Alright, so I'm a Trump supporter who didn't like the tariffs or really cared about a trade war. But now seeing how much influence China has on the American market(NBA, Disney, apple,) I want all our businesses out of China. I rather the public demand that they move out, but I now have very little problem with Trump putting heavy pressure on their economy even if it hurts ours a little. The problem is we shouldn't need the government to tell us not to deal with China. They want rain without the thunder and lightening Neither of those are mutually exclusive. You can disagree with tariffs as a matter of policy while believing it is in bad taste for businesses to cater to the Communist regime. 

When you implement tariffs you're not punishing businesses, you're punishing consumers with a general raise in the price level. That's idiotic through and through.

659,There's a new documentary about Jordan Peterson but theaters are afraid to show it,Conservative,Foubar,t5_2qh6p,di5xqz,">The film is already available [for pre-order](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-rise-of-jordan-peterson/id1479769753?mt=6&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)on iTunes and a Blu-Ray will be released at the end of the month.

Well at least people are still able to watch it in the comfort of their own home. Either way it wouldn't deter me from watching it. This guy doesn’t need a movie.

He says some smart things but some people act like he’s the Second Coming of Christ. Followed this article up with, “Alexa, who is Jordan Peterson?”  🤔 Mob mentality. These are the same minds who shut down Shapiro, Rubin, Peterson, Owens, Kirk, etc. for their appearances. Tell me who the \*real\* fascists are again? I’m a big fan of JP, but maybe, just maybe, theaters won’t show it because it won’t draw a crowd. are they even allowed to? Most theaters have screen agreements with other distributors Eh,  Jordan Peterson is a hack.  Its disappointing that more people don't see through his asinine scare mongering and play philosophy.   He is a professor of psychology and a good public speaker.  He probably knows psychology pretty well, but he is an amateur philosopher at best, he just says what people want to hear... so they look past the fact that there is no philosophical depth to what he says.

You can tell Peterson is a hack by the way he goes on about""Postmodern Neo-Marxism"" as a supposed enemy of the ""west"".   Tons of philosophy folk have broken this down, so I'm not going to get into it.  But at its core its just a bunch of buzzwords put together to sound scary.  It doesn't actually exist and he just uses it as this ambiguous umbrella term to define and dismiss the ""left"" or people who are ""anti west"".

Which brings me to the fact that anybody who believes that the ""West"" should be defined as Judaeo-Christian values and is under attack from Marxism is assuredly a hack.  That isn't what the West is.  The West is much greater than that.  You can't just pick and choose what deep rooted philosophical schools created and developed in the west are actually the ""West"".  Communism and Marxism were born in the West.  Fascism was born in the west.  Karl Marx is no less of a western philosopher than Robert Nozic or Plato and Aristotle- unless you want to carve Germany out of the ""West"".  Marxism is a part of the West's cultural history whether we like it or not. Communism is just as ""western"" as fascism or capitalism in its history and traditions.

Seriously, what is ""western civilization"", how do you define it?  Does it include Imperial Rome?  the Roman Republic?  the Greek City States?  Jordan Peterson seems to connect ""the west"" with christianity, so does that mean he cannot include these massively influential ancient philosophical traditions as ""western""? If you do include those ancient societies, do you exclude Ancient Egypt or Carthage?  If you exclude ancient Egypt and Carthage do they count as ""western civilization"" when they were part of the Roman Empire?  Does Western Civilization include the Islamic scholars in the Golden Age of Islam in Baghdad who found and preserved the literature of the ancient Greeks, ensuring that Europe would later have access to that wealth of knowledge?  Does Western Civilization include Turkey?  If it doesn't include Turkey does it include the Eastern Roman Empire?  Is Russia part of the west?  Was Prussia?   Where do you draw the bloody lines?  Peterson is no help he just says ""western civilization"" to mean ""us"" without really breaking down what that means or encompasses, and people just lap it up because it makes them feel important.

Seriously, there is no unifying umbrella of ""western civilization"".  There is British history, French history, German/Prussian history, Russian history, Roman history, Greek history, Spanish history, etc.  Its frankly insulting to lump all of these beautiful and diverse and unique cultures of ideas and philosophy into some catch all black and white term like the ""west"".

Please.  There are conservative philosophers who aren't garbage tier.  Nozic is alright, obviously Burke and Hobbes are pretty good if you can peel their lips off of the Monarchy's ass.  Stop toting around Jordan Peterson like he is a competent philosopher.  Its embarrassing and he should have stuck to psychology and writing self help books. It might be a profit issue, not sure if many of our peers are competent enough to sit through a documentary.","There's a new documentary about Jordan Peterson but theaters are afraid to show it>The film is already available [for pre-order](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-rise-of-jordan-peterson/id1479769753?mt=6&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)on iTunes and a Blu-Ray will be released at the end of the month.

672,How do you deal with the hate and being ostracized for being conservative?,Conservative,FloydGG24,t5_2qh6p,di4r52,"This goes deeper than politics. Replace ""politics"" with ""religion"", ""partner"", ""occupation"", etc. and it all comes down to how much the people in your life can tolerate you making decisions about your life that they might not agree with, and how important that opinion is to you vs the value you place on your own opinions. They're not the ones who are going to be working that job. They're not the ones spending the rest of their lives with that person. And they're not the ones who get to tell you what you can and can't believe. At the end of the day, avoiding an inconvenience for them is avoiding a life of your own for you. You define you.

Something I learned about stoicism that has always stuck with me is this: you cannot always control the people and events around you; but you can chose how you resct to them. You can control your emotions. You can chose not to react. If they can't deal- that's on them. I get it, I am in the same boat. There are sane democrats in my family, but then I have a couple that are doing exactly what you describe, and worse. I just opened my FB to see a post by a niece of mine where she and her friends were calling Trump supporters white trash. 

It is really funny how the far left think it is horrible to use any kind of reference to anyone that isn't perfectly politically correct, up until they want to bash Trump supporters, then it is everything goes. 

For a long time I just cruised on past the hateful messages and posts, did not engage in arguments , just let it slide and told myself I was taking the higher ground. But lately I have decided the higher ground isn't going to work here, and I have started fighting back.

You bet I get called ignorant and much, much worse, but I am frankly at a point that I am sick of their double standards, and I am not putting up with it anymore. 

So I guess my advice to you is to stand up for what you believe. You know in your heart that the hatefulness from them is wrong. Just try to remember that pure hatred is born of fear. They have no valid arguments, so they turn to insults. You just have to keep feeding them facts when they are spewing their lies, because in the end, the truth will win out, and everyone will see you were right all along. If they aren't open minded towards your opinions and don't want to listen to you, start to hate you, and insult you, they don't respect you as a family member..

Sorry if that sounds harsh....

I dealt with it by only talking/befriending people who actually see the point in diversity of thought and don't hate or ostracise me for my views

As a PoC, many people try to enforce this idea that I'm a race traitor, or I'm doing something wrong for believing what I believe(reasonable views...). Because those are the kind of arguments they have to fall upon when I use logic in my own

And what should we say to those people?? Fuck you. For being the very racist you claim to be fighting, for trying to control thought through identity politics and suppressing innocents who disagree with you. For labelling them fascists whilst simultaneously silencing their views. Same with other minorities, whether it be the homosexual, female, trans or any other minority community. Putting people within a tiny box, when we have such a large political spectrum is the complete opposite of the 'equality' and 'justice' these people claim to be trying to achieve.

What can one take from this comment? That people who disagree with your views, respectfully, as long as your views are within reason, are okay...

Those who try to silence you and make baseless accusations about you have no respect for you as an individual. None

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk I went through a period in college where I kept asking myself “why bother with this? It would be so much easier to just not hold these convictions and beliefs. I could just be like them and be done with it.” I was the open conservative and a frequent recipient of the political dog pile. It felt like it was me against my friends, parts of my family, classmates and professors and I that hated feeling. 

I learned to pick my battles. I also learned how to handle the casual cruelty. Fast forward ten years, lots of these people have shifted politically to my side on several key issues. Keep on doing your thing and keep your head up. They can drown in their hate. It just creates more conservatives. Honestly I don't tell anyone my political opinions and I just nod and agree.  There is no point in getting into political arguments with family and coworkers.  I just tell them I'm not really interested in politics and changed the conversation topic.  


I find friends and people I know who are conservative and I talk about events and policy with them. I usually just don't bring it up. The problem with the really far-gone left-wing types is that politics isn't just politics anymore, it's a religion. It is where they derive their core morality. They believe they are Good People *because* they believe in the right policies.

Trump may be an asshole but as far as things he's actually done, he's really not any further right than Republicans were in the 90's. He's even more left in some ways, but because he offends just about all their sacred cows in his speeches and rants he's the anti-christ over there.

Democrats in the 90's didn't act like this, at least not nearly as much. They didn't think border fencing was evil, they didn't think you were a neo-nazi for disagreeing with them, they didn't try to silence you to avoid giving you a 'platform'. The hardcore wing of the DNC has been hijacked by self-righteous morality crusaders exactly as nuts as our worst fundamentalist Evangelicals. When someone believes they are morally justified in everything they do is when you have to really worry, because there's no conscience to hold them back anymore. The really bad ones don't even consider you a human.

All that is what happens when you let politics dominate your life. I realize that regular liberals in my life that might belittle me for my stances are on a morality trip and I treat it appropriately and don't let them get to me because that's what they want. Generally if I know someone isn't capable of having a respectful political conversation with me, I don't have them. I just move on to something else and certainly wouldn't bring it up myself. It’s sometimes best to debate Progressives by asking questions you know the answers to. It’s less confrontational and they’re obligated to validate their opinions. I’m a recent ‘convert’ and a lil worried too. I think there’s a good community here, on YouTube and on Twitter. I follow PragerU and Dave Rubin among others. Also Joe Rogan although he’s pretty centrist. The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. >Not going to use this as an excuse for reason I can’t succeed in life.

No this can definitely affect your success in life. You need to drop the ego and realize the world is the way it is and not the way you want it to be.  Keep your mouth shut and be successful and vote and donate -- it will do a lot more good than exposing yourself and your career by making yourself a target for insane leftists.

What you don't realize is that the people who hate you now, and want to destroy you are just rabid animals (and they do want to destroy you, make no mistake). They aren't worth the effort, and they aren't remotely interested in the truth or logical opinions.  It is a waste of your time. F\*\*\* the haters. Stay above it. If people prove toxic by treating you like crap, don't associate with them. If that's a close family member, warn them first that you'll have to distance yourself to protect your mental well-being, and if they keep up the abuse- cut them out of your life.  


Don't associate with toxic people. You can do better than to surround yourself with people who abuse you with constant vitriol. I don't give any credence to people who think it is ok to destroy an innocent child in the womb. 9 months of inconvenience vs ending a completely innocent life. No I don't care what those people think about me. ""Others people's opinion of you is none of your business"" It does not good to talk to them about it. Time to cut the toxic people out of your life and move on.","How do you deal with the hate and being ostracized for being conservative?This goes deeper than politics. Replace ""politics"" with ""religion"", ""partner"", ""occupation"", etc. and it all comes down to how much the people in your life can tolerate you making decisions about your life that they might not agree with, and how important that opinion is to you vs the value you place on your own opinions. They're not the ones who are going to be working that job. They're not the ones spending the rest of their lives with that person. And they're not the ones who get to tell you what you can and can't believe. At the end of the day, avoiding an inconvenience for them is avoiding a life of your own for you. You define you.

Something I learned about stoicism that has always stuck with me is this: you cannot always control the people and events around you; but you can chose how you resct to them. You can control your emotions. You can chose not to react. If they can't deal- that's on them. I get it, I am in the same boat. There are sane democrats in my family, but then I have a couple that are doing exactly what you describe, and worse. I just opened my FB to see a post by a niece of mine where she and her friends were calling Trump supporters white trash. 

It is really funny how the far left think it is horrible to use any kind of reference to anyone that isn't perfectly politically correct, up until they want to bash Trump supporters, then it is everything goes. 

For a long time I just cruised on past the hateful messages and posts, did not engage in arguments , just let it slide and told myself I was taking the higher ground. But lately I have decided the higher ground isn't going to work here, and I have started fighting back.

You bet I get called ignorant and much, much worse, but I am frankly at a point that I am sick of their double standards, and I am not putting up with it anymore. 

So I guess my advice to you is to stand up for what you believe. You know in your heart that the hatefulness from them is wrong. Just try to remember that pure hatred is born of fear. They have no valid arguments, so they turn to insults. You just have to keep feeding them facts when they are spewing their lies, because in the end, the truth will win out, and everyone will see you were right all along. If they aren't open minded towards your opinions and don't want to listen to you, start to hate you, and insult you, they don't respect you as a family member..

Sorry if that sounds harsh....

I dealt with it by only talking/befriending people who actually see the point in diversity of thought and don't hate or ostracise me for my views

As a PoC, many people try to enforce this idea that I'm a race traitor, or I'm doing something wrong for believing what I believe(reasonable views...). Because those are the kind of arguments they have to fall upon when I use logic in my own

And what should we say to those people?? Fuck you. For being the very racist you claim to be fighting, for trying to control thought through identity politics and suppressing innocents who disagree with you. For labelling them fascists whilst simultaneously silencing their views. Same with other minorities, whether it be the homosexual, female, trans or any other minority community. Putting people within a tiny box, when we have such a large political spectrum is the complete opposite of the 'equality' and 'justice' these people claim to be trying to achieve.

What can one take from this comment? That people who disagree with your views, respectfully, as long as your views are within reason, are okay...

Those who try to silence you and make baseless accusations about you have no respect for you as an individual. None

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk I went through a period in college where I kept asking myself “why bother with this? It would be so much easier to just not hold these convictions and beliefs. I could just be like them and be done with it.” I was the open conservative and a frequent recipient of the political dog pile. It felt like it was me against my friends, parts of my family, classmates and professors and I that hated feeling. 

I learned to pick my battles. I also learned how to handle the casual cruelty. Fast forward ten years, lots of these people have shifted politically to my side on several key issues. Keep on doing your thing and keep your head up. They can drown in their hate. It just creates more conservatives. Honestly I don't tell anyone my political opinions and I just nod and agree.  There is no point in getting into political arguments with family and coworkers.  I just tell them I'm not really interested in politics and changed the conversation topic.  


I find friends and people I know who are conservative and I talk about events and policy with them. I usually just don't bring it up. The problem with the really far-gone left-wing types is that politics isn't just politics anymore, it's a religion. It is where they derive their core morality. They believe they are Good People *because* they believe in the right policies.

Trump may be an asshole but as far as things he's actually done, he's really not any further right than Republicans were in the 90's. He's even more left in some ways, but because he offends just about all their sacred cows in his speeches and rants he's the anti-christ over there.

Democrats in the 90's didn't act like this, at least not nearly as much. They didn't think border fencing was evil, they didn't think you were a neo-nazi for disagreeing with them, they didn't try to silence you to avoid giving you a 'platform'. The hardcore wing of the DNC has been hijacked by self-righteous morality crusaders exactly as nuts as our worst fundamentalist Evangelicals. When someone believes they are morally justified in everything they do is when you have to really worry, because there's no conscience to hold them back anymore. The really bad ones don't even consider you a human.

All that is what happens when you let politics dominate your life. I realize that regular liberals in my life that might belittle me for my stances are on a morality trip and I treat it appropriately and don't let them get to me because that's what they want. Generally if I know someone isn't capable of having a respectful political conversation with me, I don't have them. I just move on to something else and certainly wouldn't bring it up myself. It’s sometimes best to debate Progressives by asking questions you know the answers to. It’s less confrontational and they’re obligated to validate their opinions. I’m a recent ‘convert’ and a lil worried too. I think there’s a good community here, on YouTube and on Twitter. I follow PragerU and Dave Rubin among others. Also Joe Rogan although he’s pretty centrist. The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. >Not going to use this as an excuse for reason I can’t succeed in life.

No this can definitely affect your success in life. You need to drop the ego and realize the world is the way it is and not the way you want it to be.  Keep your mouth shut and be successful and vote and donate -- it will do a lot more good than exposing yourself and your career by making yourself a target for insane leftists.

What you don't realize is that the people who hate you now, and want to destroy you are just rabid animals (and they do want to destroy you, make no mistake). They aren't worth the effort, and they aren't remotely interested in the truth or logical opinions.  It is a waste of your time. F\*\*\* the haters. Stay above it. If people prove toxic by treating you like crap, don't associate with them. If that's a close family member, warn them first that you'll have to distance yourself to protect your mental well-being, and if they keep up the abuse- cut them out of your life.

I'd say it's a combination of 2 things..

1. What you mentioned, women developing these diseases/addictions after killing their own child
2. Woman having pre-existing conditions so bad that they think it's okay to kill their own child....

Both of them individually, or combined together, show a trend that killing your own child is linked to a pre-existing terrible mental condition, or develops one Not to be that guy, but is there a chance that the implied cause/effect scenario here is inverted?

It doesn't seem far fetched to imagine that women with less self control and mental resilience would be the ones who would engage in activities that lead themselves to a situation where they would want an abortion in the first place. All the women I know that've had abortions ended up regretting it. Maybe not immediately, but 5-10 years later when they did have kids and realized their little baby could have had an older brother or sister.

I don't think abortions should be illegal (early first trimester), but this misconception that it's somehow empowering is damaging to women. It's preached as a quick get-in get-out procedure and that can be long-term emotional and hormonal effects. And yet, abortion is celebrated as some glorious action. I can’t imagine why.

/s for the blind I haven’t always been as politically conservative as I am now, and there was a point in time when I argued for an acceptable window in which to abort a child, because of the fact that, yeah, for a while it’s just replicating cells, and doesn’t have any sentience. I used to be a cringe atheist type that argued about how it’s not really life until it has a brain and nerves and stuff. 

Now though.... now, I have 2 kids and we just found out my wife is carrying number 3. I look at things differently now. I look at things as one big picture timeline. I don’t look at the pregnancy she is carrying now as 2 weeks of cell growth without a brain yet, I look at it like 10 years from now that clump of cells is in 4th grade and takes piano lessons. 19 years from now that clump of cells graduates from high school. 45 years from now I’ll be cared for by my own child, whom I love and cherish and couldn’t imagine being without, and right now, at this point in time, he or she just happens to be a clump of cells. However if I remove those cells from existence, I remove an entire timeline, and entire life of love and dreams and experiences. 
 
You can’t look at it as doing some thing in the now, when you think about abortion, you have to think about it as removing the seed of an entire life that a person will have, and then whether or not we all determine if it counts as “life” yet becomes irrelevant, because even if we agree that it isn’t a living Thing yet, if you get rid of it you’re pulling the plug on an entire lifetime of a humans life. Nobody thinks about said timeline in terms of years from now, it’s always an argument about what the cells are determined to be only right now, and that’s the wrong way to think about it. Both serious mental illness and abortion are disproportionally common in low-income populations. It's not necessarily that one causes the other...but that a systemic lack of access to health care, insurance, and resources (including birth control) tend to lead to unhealthy lifestyles and choices.

This reminds me of when the Democrats finally got a lottery passed here in Texas by saying it would be used to fund poor schools. Once it passed, they used the money to pay off state employee unions. I am glad that i left CA couple of years ago. And yes, aside from high tax (and terrifying housing costs), horrible traffic is another reason that I am happy that i have left.

And news coming out of CA keeps validating my choice. Heck, this story validates two points for the price of one! This is par for course for Democrats. They threatened roads/police/schools cuts if only they could squeeze more taxes out of us. Once they squeeze those taxes out they redirect general funding to the pockets of unions and their donors and those programs see no actual increase in spending. 

It pisses me off to no end when the fucking idiots vote to increase taxes to ""fund schools"" when we all know schools won't see a dime in increased spending. After all the tax increases I still had to buy supplies for my kid's kindergarten classroom and I have nearly bi-monthly requests for donations so the school can function.

It is corrupt to the core. And the Democrat voters couldn't give a fuck about results. It's all about virtue signalling. Hey we saved the oceans by banning straws and bags! Nope, not really, not even close... and you increased food born diseases among the population. Nice job asshats. Straws were literally invented to reduce the spread of diseases at restaurants... It's almost as if these morons want us to return to the medieval ages so they can feel good about issues that aren't actually being fixed by their asinine policies.

Democrats need to be confronted with the fact that they don't care about results. Gavin Newson literally failed upwards to becoming Governor. His tenure as Mayor of SF was abject failure. Did the voters care? Did Gavin Newson even bother filling out a bio on the voter information guide (hint no, he knew the idiots of this state were going to elect him no matter what he wrote, said, or did). This is not surprising. Democrats pull this move all the time, which is why voting for higher taxes for ""infrastructure improvements"" is usually a terrible idea as the money invariably goes into a slush fund for politicians to use as they please. And unless there are provisions put in place to ensure that funds raised from tax increases will be applied to the projects they were specifically raised for, you're a fool for voting for them.

He looks like he’s out there with candy coaxing children closer... Americans are leaving the Catholic Church in droves, they need the Hispanics to replace them. The wall is cutting off their supply. Okay.

So, why does this bishop hate the little children trafficked across the open borders?

Who suffers more - those children who were allowed to be raped, or the adults who were disallowed entry?

Simple question. Lol as if anyone cares what the catholic church says anymore. Screw em. ""WTF, I love Christianity now"" - leftists I am officially boycotting the Catholic Church. No more money to them  I can attend other services. Yeah, coming from a guy who has more than likely raped several children over the course of his career.

He obviously knew what Turkey was going to do when we retreated ... That we are sanctioning them for this is political cover I guess. 

The Kurds were our best ally against ISIS and it wasn't necessary for us to pull out and let them die. >  **Article:**

What a fiasco. Foreign-policy blunders often take months or years to reveal their damaging consequences, but the harm from President Trump’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria is playing out almost in real time.

Critics said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would invade northern Syria despite Mr. Trump’s public warnings, and the Turkish strongman did. Critics said our Kurdish allies would strike a deal with Syria’s Bashar Assad to defend themselves, and the Kurds have. Critics said Islamic State prisoners held by the Kurds would be released and scatter to wage jihad again, and they are.

The mess compounded Monday when Mr. Trump authorized sanctions against several Turkish officials and agencies who are “contributing to Turkey’s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.” The sanctions include financial measures and barring entry to the U.S. Mr. Trump also said he’s ending trade talks with Turkey and raising steel tariffs to 50%.

Mr. Trump now finds himself back in an economic and diplomatic brawl with Turkey that he said he wanted to avoid. Wouldn’t it have been easier simply to tell Mr. Erdogan, on that famous phone call two Sundays ago, that the U.S. wouldn’t tolerate a Turkish invasion against the Kurds and would use air power to stop it? Mr. Erdogan would have had to back down and continue negotiating a Syrian safe zone with the Kurds and the U.S.

Mr. Trump is also making matters worse with his unserious justifications. “After defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land,” he tweeted Monday. “Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!”

We suppose the Napoleon line was a joke, but the world is laughing at an American President. Mr. Trump was able to project an image of strength in his early days as he prosecuted the war against ISIS and used force to impose a cost on Mr. Assad for using chemical weapons. But that image has faded as he has indulged his inner Rand Paul and claims at every opportunity that the main goal of his foreign policy is to put an end to “endless wars.”

This is simple-minded isolationism, and it’s a message to the world’s rogues that a U.S. President has little interest in engaging on behalf of American allies or interests. Friends like Israel and Saudi Arabia are quietly dismayed, while Iran, Russia and Hezbollah can’t believe Mr. Trump has so glibly abandoned U.S. commitments and military partners.

By now it’s not unreasonable to conclude that Mr. Trump’s foreign policy can be distilled into two tactics—sanctions and tariffs. Mr. Trump wields them willy-nilly against friend and foe alike as substitutes for diplomacy and the credible threat of military force.

Mr. Trump won’t like to hear it, but the Syrian mess is hurting him at home too. Republicans who have stood by him through the Russia fight and more are questioning his judgment as Commander in Chief in an increasingly dangerous world. With impeachment looming, he can’t afford to alienate more friends. 50 US soldiers, really?  If those 50 bodies were of such grave global importance any one of our allies could have put people there.","WSJ Editorial Board: President’s Syria MessThis will not go down as one of Trump's finest moments.

731,Bill McGurn: Bill Barr ‘Gets’ Religion,Conservative,ChunkyArsenio,t5_2qh6p,dhz4vw,">  **Speech:**

https://youtu.be/W4OQTKdjFR8?t=234


>  **Article:**

For Notre Dame fans, this football weekend was a twofer. Not only did the Irish beat a longtime rival, the University of Southern California, on Saturday, the campus was treated to a sight it had never before seen: the attorney general of the United States, at a pregame tailgater, serenading faculty, students and fans with his bagpipes.

Turns out that was William Barr’s second performance on campus. The first came at the law school Friday, when he delivered a bracing speech on the role of religion in the American story of freedom.

The attorney general advanced two broad propositions. First, the waning of religion’s influence in American life has left more of her citizens vulnerable to what Tocqueville called the “soft despotism” of government dependency. Second, today’s secularists are decidedly not of the live-and-let-live variety.

“The secular project has itself become a religion, pursued with religious fervor,” he said. “It is taking on all the trappings of religion, including inquisitions and excommunication. Those who defy the creed risk a figurative burning at the stake—social, educational and professional ostracism and exclusion waged through lawsuits and savage social media campaigns.”

Right out of central casting, critics stepped forward to prove his point. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman accused Mr. Barr of “religious bigotry” and described his words as a “pogrom type speech.”

Political ethicist and professional attention seeker Richard Painter tapped out a series of even more furious tweets, here calling the speech the latest episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” there suggesting Mr. Barr isn’t much of a Christian, here again saying Mr. Barr sounded like “vintage Goebbels.” Over at MSNBC, meanwhile, retired Army Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, once chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, told Joy Reid the attorney general is “Torquemada in a business suit,” a reference to the Spanish Inquisition’s grand inquisitor.

This is what we have come to expect when someone in public life mentions religion in a positive light. Many didn’t like Mr. Barr’s blaming secularism for social pathologies such as drug addiction, family breakdown and increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males. Yet few engaged his more arresting contention, which is that all these problems have spiritual roots. Whereas religion addresses such challenges by stressing personal responsibility, Mr. Barr argued, the state’s answer is merely to try to alleviate “bad consequences.”

“So the reaction to growing illegitimacy is not sexual responsibility, but abortion,” he said. “The reaction to drug addiction is safe injection sites. The solution to the breakdown of the family is for the state to set itself up as an ersatz husband for the single mother and an ersatz father for the children. The call comes for more and more social programs to deal with this wreckage—and while we think we’re solving problems, we are underwriting them.”

Vincent Phillip Muñoz, a Notre Dame professor, notes there was nothing particularly Catholic about this speech. Like Washington in his Farewell Address, he says, Mr. Barr focused on the irreplaceable role of religion in cultivating the morality citizens need to be capable of self-government.

“The speech wasn’t first and foremost about religious freedom,” says Mr. Muñoz. “It was about the human and social consequences of the new secular morality, and what happens when the state views its citizens not only in purely material terms, but as subjects who can’t really govern themselves.”

Even those who strongly disagree with Mr. Barr ought to have found this an invitation for thoughtful and vigorous debate. But rather than engage, some imply there is something unseemly about an attorney general’s even speaking at a Catholic university. Given the hostility that holding such a conversation engenders on campuses today, perhaps America can count itself fortunate it still has a university where this can happen.

Carter Snead, the law professor who invited Mr. Barr, puts it this way: “At Notre Dame, we are not afraid to explore the hard questions about God, religion and America together in friendship, especially on those matters about which people strongly disagree.”

Mr. Barr’s argument has been echoed throughout American history: “Our Constitution was made for only for a moral and religious people” (John Adams). “Liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith” (Tocqueville). “In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization. For ‘not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God’ shall our democracy be founded” (FDR). And so on.

That so many would become unhinged by Mr. Barr’s relatively modest contribution to the genre is highly revealing of the absolutism of secularist opponents determined to marginalize and destroy anyone who dares dissent from their own uncompromising orthodoxy. Which religion? So happy to see someone like AG Barr as a leader.","Bill McGurn: Bill Barr ‘Gets’ Religion>  **Speech:**

""I hate Trump, vote for me.""","Steyer: If GOP Wins in 2020, 'Literally It Could Be the End of the World'OMG! More of the doomsday predictions! Sometimes I kinda wish WW3 would just pop off so these people could really have something to be afraid of. /s Anytime a Lib says ""literally"" you can't bet your ass they are lying theirs off. Private citizens retaining rights, lower taxes for all, and a president who doesn’t take crap from other leaders. The horror! 😞 Let me change that prediction... ~~If~~ WHEN GOP wins in 2020, there will be a LOT of you (D)s behind bars... Trump is doing a damn fine job so far in overturning the rocks the slimeball (D)s are hiding under. >""We are in the fight of our lives,"" Steyer said. ""Everything is on the table in 2020. They think so too, because they think if they lose in 2020 the rules are going to be fair and they're never going to win again                        

If they win the rules will be fair which naturally means a perpetual one party state. Another good quote ""If we win in 2020 they are done forever."" ""The sky is falling"" I think the Left is going to have their asses handed to them in 2020. And it will be because not all of them want to go to Wonderland. As they know it It's literally the end of the world as we know it.  
And I literally feel fine. Translation:  If the GOP wins in 2020, it could be the end of *his* world.

Next Pelosi will say the accused will get to read the evidence after they convict. That tips the scales of justice, and bends it into a pretzel.  

Sounds right out of the nazi SS or russian FSB (Secret police stuff) While these yahoos are playing behind closed doors, can't the rest of the House pass some sort of resolution to allow access? I'm just not understanding how they can be kept in the dark, and be completely powerless. If their case against Trump is as compelling as they claim, why the cloak and dagger stuff?

Then again, they had an airtight case for ""Russian collusion,"" and look how that turned out. The House will vote based on what they are told by their leadership and the Public must swallow whatever the D's are spoon feeding them:

* No release of actual testimony, just what the D's selectively leak
* Carefully selected witnesses that support their narrative; no rebuttal/alternate, less friendly, witnesses heard from even if more expert and first hand witnesses. etc.

Democracy at work. Serious question, isn't this the investigative phase, and the trial is in the Senate?

Number seems low. 16 million Jews for the Nazis is also about 10 million too high. Also for the record when Turkey committed their genocide against the Armenians, Greeks and Circassians in Turkey also were ethnically cleansed killing a further couple million and basically eliminating Christianity from Anatolia. When Castro took over Cuba, the first thing he did was take everyone’s guns. Good examples, but a counterexample is in order: The UK has long ago largely disarmed it's populace, but no massacre has occurred yet. So while disarmament of the populace is a necessary precursor to massacre, it is not sufficient to make it happen. I say we keep that check in place. Make it as difficult as possible to murder Americans. This is profound. Any stats on Venezuela disarming its citizens? ""I like taking guns away early""

 ""Take the guns first, go through due process second."" Yeah but has this ever happened in a democracy? 1996 - Australia disarms populace after the Port Arthur massacre

Nonsense, Cambodia's government changed in 1970 and the country was awash in weapons afterwards before Pol Pot took over in 1975.

She's nearing Beto-level irrelevancy as it becomes more and more apparent that the only people in the race that matter anymore are Warren and Biden. I said that about you when you announced your campaign. It's the playbook.

He caught them off guard by releasing it showing there accusations were bullshit. But in politics you never admit you're wrong. So they **double downed**. They've been doing this for nearly 2 decades, and when the media act as a propaganda arm you can get away with it.

The same thing happens when Project Veritas reveals their deeply corrupt and immoral acts. First deflect, saying that a proper investigation should happen.

Maybe someone can walk me through it.

The way I understood it is that Free Speech applies to my right to say what I want on public property- with some limited exceptions (children at school don't have full free speech protections, and inciting violence is not protected, etc).   So I can go to city hall, or a public park, or a public university and say my spiel- or get a permit to say my spiel.

What I don't have is a right to venue.  A private venue.  This seems obvious, right?  Like, its my house, I can control what is said in it.   My house, my rules.   The First Amendment doesn't protect my right to come into your house and run my mouth off .  Similarly, the First Amendment doesn't apply to private businesses either.    Akaean's coffee shop and dinner theater can choose what events it wants to host, the First Amendment doesn't compel a privately owned coffee shop to host speakers or events that the owner doesn't want.

So then we get to Facebook.  Facebook is a privately owned company, ergo Facebook has the right to regulate speech on its privately owned servers.  Just like my imaginary coffee shop and dinner theater venue would have the right to regulate speech within its walls.   Facebook isn't a public space, like a public park or street or university... so it doesn't, and shouldn't, have any First Amendment requirements to host speech that corporate doesn't agree with.

If you feel that Facebook doesn't honor conservative values, or if you feel that Facebook is choosing not to host conservative thought.  That is their right as a private entity to regulate the speech on its property.  You have two options.  1) Convert Facebook into a public entity.  If Facebook is a government controlled entity then the First Amendment must apply to it.  2) Create a competitor to Facebook and out compete Facebook on the open market.

And don't give me this Facebook's servers are a public space argument.  You can argue that the ""internet"" is a public space, but Facebook is not.  Facebook has lots of competitors, it out competed MySpace, it currently competes with Instagram, Twitter, and Imgur at various levels.  If you wanted to make Conservative book that is totally your prerogative.  Its not my fault, nor is it Facebook's fault, if you cannot build a worthy competitor.

Maybe its just me, but it seems pretty darn socialist for the government to step in and force private entities to host speech those private entities don't want to.  It also seems pretty darn socialist for the government to step in and take ownership of private companies.

EDIT:  Of course you can and should complain about what Facebook chooses to air.  Free speech lets you complain all you want about things you want.  You can also boycott facebook and use whatever social media platform Yahoo is offering or whatever.  But that doesn't a constitutional or first amendment violation make.

This book will take you on a dark journey. This is the true story of child abuse that occurred at the hands of that filth John Money - who was supposed to be a trusted expert but instead only cared about advancing his own special poison.

Have to hand it to Colapinto - he writes with true compassion and determination in the face of an ugly, horrible situation. 

RIP David Reimer. Parents that do this should be considered guilty of felony child abuse.

Leftists must absolutely despise children, the way they insist on torturing them physically and mentally.  Is there really any good reason to totally freak a 3 year old out over climate issues, for example? It seems the parents were following the advice of doctors after his circumcision was botched badly. I would like to know why in the world the doctor performed a circumcision with CAUTERIZATION in the first place!? Rather than perform a normal circumcision, you're gonna burn it off. 

Also, yeah, if anything, this is genuine proof that pushing the idea of being trans to children is a bad idea. Even if it's the kid who makes the choice, it's also the kid that will suffer later once they grow up and come to understand things better. This was the genesis of modern gender theory. This disgusting inhuman story. Wow, so you only care about people who were raised as the wrong gender when they were unwillingly given sex reassignment surgery? Minus that, this is essentially the same as any trans boy who was mistreated and abused for not identifying as a girl. He is now an eternal Democrat voter.","TIL about David Reimer, who, as a young boy, was given sex reassignment surgery and raised as a female for 15 years, until his parents revealed to him that he was born male.

This book will take you on a dark journey. This is the true story of child abuse that occurred at the hands of that filth John Money - who was supposed to be a trusted expert but instead only cared about advancing his own special poison.

Have to hand it to Colapinto - he writes with true compassion and determination in the face of an ugly, horrible situation. 

RIP David Reimer. Parents that do this should be considered guilty of felony child abuse.

Leftists must absolutely despise children, the way they insist on torturing them physically and mentally.  Is there really any good reason to totally freak a 3 year old out over climate issues, for example? It seems the parents were following the advice of doctors after his circumcision was botched badly. I would like to know why in the world the doctor performed a circumcision with CAUTERIZATION in the first place!? Rather than perform a normal circumcision, you're gonna burn it off. 

Also, yeah, if anything, this is genuine proof that pushing the idea of being trans to children is a bad idea. Even if it's the kid who makes the choice, it's also the kid that will suffer later once they grow up and come to understand things better. This was the genesis of modern gender theory. This disgusting inhuman story. Wow, so you only care about people who were raised as the wrong gender when they were unwillingly given sex reassignment surgery? Minus that, this is essentially the same as any trans boy who was mistreated and abused for not identifying as a girl. He is now an eternal Democrat voter."

820,PART 1: CNN Insider Blows Whistle on Network President Jeff Zucker’s Personal Vendetta Against POTUS – Project Veritas,Conservative,ngoni,t5_2qh6p,dhtvri,"
 If you suspected many CNN employees are biased hard to the left, and if you suspect that they are well aware of their own bias but work under the cover of objective journalism anyway, then this video gives you some pretty good evidence to support that.

 The most egregious quote probably comes from Zucker who bitches about Fox News conspiracy theories after his network pushed 2+ years of the Trump/Russia collusion hoax. Pathetic.

 But there's nothing really new here, or anything that you could use to nail CNN for libel, slander, defamation, etc. Just a tacit admission that they're anti-Trump and see themselves as such, which most people paying attention already knew. This hasn't really told me anything I don't already know. 

Of course Don Lemon hates Trump. Don Lemon is a racist hack pretending to be a journalist. Honestly, this was good to see, but if anything I'm actually surprised how much CNN likes the smell of their own farts. I thought you would see people admitting to a coordinated effort to work with Democrats to impeach Trump, not just a bunch of people who hate Trump that think they are doing God's work. They are still completely delusional, but I don't get the sense that they are glorified Democrat operatives. At this point, I'm not sure which is worse, but this wasn't what I was expecting. Is anybody really surprised? All news is biased, to a degree, either to the left or right. Fox News is on the right and CNN is sucking the left.  What else is new?  This video is pointless. Why isn't this on r/politics Well, we already knew that. If the insider told us that Jeff Zucker loves Trump, then my mind be blown. [removed] This is stuff that was already known.

People feel it is their duty to correct a wrong. Get Trump out of office, no matter what.

Journalism be dammed, get the dirt and if you cant find the dirt, act like there is some. Go in full bias and dont give the opposition any win. Resist everything. This is definitely getting some people fired. I'm salivating waiting for part 5 Good luck finding it using Google or Bing. I keep trying with no luck. Clearly they are both preventing it from showing up. Awesome work by project Veritas.  Totally damming to CNN and Jeff Zucker.  It wasn’t like we had to guess about this!  Everyone knows CNN is totally biased...this was just proof!  Check out Tucker Carson’s show tonight for more! I bet the left found a whistleblower it doesn't like... Zucker says this is the ""Story"" of impeachment, its not news, its a made up story, anti-trump fan fiction. It confirms what most of us already knew. I honestly don't see anything very substantive. No red pills. All main stream media is fake news! Is there a name for O'keefe's production style? It just seems so bad to me but it must be following some set of rules. He plays like the same clip 3-4 times and it just weakens the impact I think. He'd be much better off with some shorter heavier hitting non repetitive videos.

Nick Neville seems like a good guy who gets it. Probably one of the unintended side effects of this video is showing that there really are some decent people out there in media they just have little to no influence over what these media giants are doing or covering. It's all being dictated by the big personalities and guys at the top. Style points for PV posting the conference call this morning where Zucker said he wasn't concerned. >Zucker to Staffers: “Impeachment is the Story,” Ignore Other Stories

I practically hear this in my own newsroom Finally, a news story about a *real* whistleblower. LOVE me some projectveritas! I think secretly recording people on both sides is fucked up. Is this going to be like their Google interview with an obvious paid PV actor talking about being taken to the temple of moloch? lol","PART 1: CNN Insider Blows Whistle on Network President Jeff Zucker’s Personal Vendetta Against POTUS – Project Veritas

Now she's angry at POTUS over a meme some kid made because it shows her dying in the cultural cold civil war she is actively participating in. How rich... Hypocrisy much? Anyone have a link to the video of trump offiing all those people? Typical leftist. Rules for thee, none for me. She'd have been fine if it was just Trump holding her severed head.  Youbetcha. Oh no! Now she’s outraged! How terrible! Why anyone gives this fool any publicity is beyond me.  She's not even a ""B-list"" celebrity any more. Don’t be fooled.  She’s all too happy to have ANYONE paying attention to her. In her mind she is a ""famous celebrity"" on a campaign against the evil orange man. The reality is she's a has been / never was, desperate for publicity and relevance.

Only important people get death threats, no harm is headed her way.  Watching her flail in the wind, has been the most entertainment she's ever provided. So turnabout is not fair play where Chatty Kathy is concerned? Seems like she doesn't have very good memory. These democrats remind me of a sociopathic ex girlfriend i had.

It gets to a point where the sheer absurdity of it all is paralyzing. Given context and history you couldn't possibly expect anyone to follow this much broken logic and fragrant hypocrisy right? But here we are. Like there are so many things wrong on so many levels it's impossible to figure out where to even start deconstructing. Oh boo hoo, poor Kathy. Karma. I can understand why she would be upset.  That is almost as bad as publishing a picture holding someone elses severed head.

852,The Origins of the Transgender Movement -- We must not ignore cultural blind spots that put children at risk of abuse.,Conservative,guanaco55,t5_2qh6p,dhs7gp,"The piece points out the dirty secret of modern trans and gender dogma, namely that the insistence that gender and identity are separate altogether from sexuality and sexual preference is just a a fig leaf.  Most of the trendy gender categories, and the pious conceit that some men are really women and vice versa, are but fronts for minority sexual desires and preferences, with social ""science"" supposedly conferring some sort of validity to the latest fetishes and affectations.

The desperate need for sexual minorities to see themselves reflected in children remains priority one, with the repugnant--and predictable--result that children are sexualized at an ever younger age.  Children are encouraged to explore their own sex and identity and to make decisions and announcements as a matter of autonomous right--all for their own health and protection, dontchaknow.  We come full circle to the old NAMBLA predator's mantra that minors are competent to make their ""own"" sexual decisions.

The fake gulf between gender and identity versus sex and sexuality provides the cover for many adult LGBTQers to project and enact their particularized, unwholesome fantasies.  

The writer of this National Review piece speaks with young Human Rights Campaign activists.  Are they aware that the sixty-something co-founder of HRC, Obama campaign bundler Terry Bean, who came up in political activism with self-acknowledged chickenhawk Harvey Milk, today faces criminal molestation charges for the alleged sexual violation of a fifteen year-old boy in a Eugene, Oregon hotel room?

It's like they're making a hobby out of insulting our intelligence at this point.  I'm skeptical that he isn't dead but alive and free someplace on a newer private island setting up the same shit for them still. As soon as he went behind bars everyone including him knew he was a dead man. Ppl that dislike the right think they were behind it and ppl that dislike the left think the left was behind it. 

He most likely had dirt on both sides so they probably had no issues setting aside differences to save their hides by killing him. 

I have to wonder that someone like that has to have a plan to make a dirt dump if this happens That was 5 weeks ago?  Holy shit I've got two huge questions.

1. Where is Maxwell?

2. Where are/were his current girls?

You would think that the major news sources or basically anyone with a platform would be asking this blatantly on a Twitter profile somewhere. But it seems that no one has asked the most important questions. Because if we find out the answer to each of these we will be able to find out a lot more in the case obviously. Why is there a picture of Scott Bakula there? On to the next outrage. Hong Kong will be forgotten about in 2 weeks too. Nah, I'm not forgetting the Epstein shit. I've already added ""pulling an Epstein"" to my daily slang as a ways of saying ""I want to kill myself"". As have the people I usually talk to. We only forget if we let ourselves forget. I wouldn’t say killed, more likely he was allowed to die The real reason Epstein was killed: he was running a money laundering operation on a massive scale with ties to the CIA.  FASAB 56 was quietly passed last year while everyone was so enthralled with kavanaugh's sex life. Fasab 56 gave the federal government 0.0 responsibility to keep books on the federal securities market. Anyone remember the $21,000,000,000,000 that the Pentagon never kept books on?  They didn't keep books on it because America would be pissed if they found out what they are doing with the paychecks we give them.  They were using Epstein to funnel the money going to these shell companies used for shadow operations.  Did anyone wonder why the hell this all came up after over a decade of people screaming that a pedophile is running money management operations for shell companies linked with high profile politicians and corporatists around the world??  With fasab 56 passed, there is no need for money laundering wizards like Epstein anymore. We still haven't gotten answers on the Las Vegas shooter. Ya, I can't believe the president of the united states is getting away with this. Thanks for the reminder. This is just what they want us to do. I will never forget they found a painting of Bill Clinton in a dress. Please continue to post this. The dems are really good at getting their sheep sidetracked. It doesn't take much, just point at a white guy. I was just thinking about him today That’s some heavy stuff It's crazy how quickly the media has stopped talking about him. How do I give this 500 points?! [removed] One man is in the white house and the other one was in the white house As an independent, thank you. Both sides can agree that this guy was a piece of shit and the people involved shouldn’t get away. 

It’s a long shot, but we can try. [removed] Yeah what ever came of this? Dude was straight up murdered. I have no remorse, excepting that Bill's name is all over this. [deleted] Weird. I didn't know I was subscribed to /r/the_donald. Or I mean you know... MAYBE other inmates killed him just because they hated him because he molested children.  MAYBE the moon landing was real too.

WHY ARENT PEOPLE MORE OUTRAGED?!?!?!?!?!!?!? because Donald Trump is the LEAST implicated in the Epstein syndicate (as far as we know) 

Edit: extra words Is anyone clinging to the hope that Epstein is still alive? I want so badly to believe that Trump ordered he be put in witness protection, faked his death to hide him. Hm yes, I really hope they investigate his links to AG Barr's father. OH MY GOD FOR THE LAST FUCKING TIME IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A SUICIDE Idk, I think he might have just been a CIA honey pot that went bad.

Wtf.

Calendar has Columbus Day / Indigenous Peoples Day.

Your virtue signaling cost me a PAID DAY OFF.

Fuuuuuuu I’ve never heard someone frame the situation so eloquently and strongly. At the rate we're headed we'll be block from landing a man/woman on Mars for fears of resource extraction while simultaneously being lectured about a dying planet.

Michael Knowles does a great job here of showing how history refutes the narrative being pushed. I'm glad we have people fighting the narratives people have painted to fit their own worldview. And a happy Columbus day to you as well

Side not... was born here....so I AM A NATIVE AMERICAN!!! Thanks, Chris. The Native Americans can have their own federal holiday on a separate day. They didn't bring cultures who made the US a 1st world country. I don't always agree with Knowles, but his history pieces are always amazing. I always go in thinking he has no chance of changing my mind, but the dude always does. [removed]","Happy Columbus Day!I'm really starting to appreciate Michael Knowles more and more.  He always has interesting insights and is able to articulate them very eloquently.

84k people is a lot of people to kill, especially in ritualistic sacrifice. **That works out to one sacrifice every 6.3 minutes for an entire year**, without taking a break. And that doesn't speak to the logistics of keeping 84k people imprisoned and alive while they wait to be sacrificed.  And then dealing with 84k dead and decomposing bodies?

I'd love to see the source on this one.

**Edit -- found this on wikipedia:** 

> Some post-conquest sources report that at the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, the Aztecs sacrificed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. **This number is considered by Ross Hassig, author of Aztec Warfare, to be an exaggeration**. Hassig states ""between 10,000 and 80,400 persons"" were sacrificed in the ceremony.[11] The higher estimate would average 15 sacrifices per minute during the four-day consecration. Four tables were arranged at the top so that the victims could be jettisoned down the sides of the temple.[18] Nonetheless, according to Codex Telleriano-Remensis, old **Aztecs who talked with the missionaries told about a much lower figure for the reconsecration of the temple, approximately 4,000 victims in total**. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture#Scope_of_Human_Sacrifice_In_Aztec_Culture

So, it was a **four-day sacrifice**, and the actual number of sacrifices varies from 4k to 80.4k.  Imagine trying to deal with 20k sacrifices and dead bodies per day? The Nazi's weren't even able to reach those numbers. The fringes of the left want to eliminate the notion and vocabulary that some of these indigenous peoples’ tribes were “savages.” *Whilst at the same time* have the audacity to call people who support Trump “nazis and savages.” The hypocrisy is unparalleled when it comes to the democrat party. Hmm reading up on the history behind this I’m getting numbers from 4,000 to 80,400. never the less human sacrifice and the belief of that is recessive to the betterment of humanity. But ya know Columbus bad man etc etc The Spanish were not benevolent visitors who came to spread their advanced technology like some ancient alien here to help build the pyramids.  They came to plunder and rape.  Georgio Tsoukalos has the world believing aliens come here with only good intentions but when you get taken don't cry when you feel the probe. Cortés 2020. ""When you arrive on a new continent and loudly proclaim that you're going to rape and enslave to your heart's content, but you'll outlaw human sacrifice, so the locals see you as a progressive reformer.""

 ~ Just Cortez Things. What do these numbers mean? In 5 years they sacrificed 84k? Or up until that point, they sacrificed 84k? They made great temples tho “Hey dude, that’s their religion and you should celebrate their genocidal practices. Chris Columbus was white so it’s wrong for him to do it” It blows my mind that people genuinely think all of the native tribes lived in peace and harmony and weren’t constantly slaughtering each other to gain land and power.  And then the “white man” showed up and ruined everything... Just trying to feed the pillar men No society in human history has ever been without some fucked up thing. The natives sacrificed people, scalped people, and some where even cannibals. The Europeans killed off most of the tribes by direct and indirect means. Neither side was good. In term of nature though the strong (Europeans with guns) conquered the weak (the natives with bows and clubs). I think “indigenous people’s day” is better than Columbus day because Columbus, according to historians, either didn’t exist or committed many atrocities against the native peoples. They did fucked up shit too but we can’t say that for every Native American tribe. Celebrating a man who was responsible for the rape and murder of  thousands of Natives never seems like a good idea. Columbus Day is about Italian-Americans and how we've contributed to American history. Columbus is just the name since he was the first Italian to come to the New World. **Democrats:** The Confederates lost. Get over it, Nazi bigots.

**Also Democrats:** How dare white settlers defeat indigenous barbarians in war. This is an atrocious act that must be rectified with white guilt and reparations. I mean, your not wrong, but Columbus was kind of a cunt 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yeah.....and they would have killed them **ALL** by now had the white man not come i......

*^(wait....what?)* Indigenous People is such a lie of a term.  The only places where people haven't been conquered and replaced is a few remote Pacific Islands.  Everyone else is descendant of conquerors or immigrants. They also raised humans like cattle for consumption This makes me think of a blog post I wrote recently:

Because it's being done in the name of Islam. It's because the west does not give a shit about Africa. Slavery has existed in Africa for thousands of years.  Africa is one of the few places on Earth where slavery is **still legal**.  The slaves who were brought to America from Africa were already slaves, born into slavery, and sold by their African owners to American slave traders.

However, Americans treated their slaves much worse than how they were treated in Africa, where they were treated more like unpaid servants (not whipped and tortured).

The latest excuse is they don't now enough to comment, and that they are much more well versed about what's happening in their own 'backyard'. Because the media is controlled by the party of slavery

Unfortunately this happens on a daily basis and nothing will be done. That video and all mentions of it have been pulled from ABC News sites.  That's a start, but they should follow it up with a published apology and formal retraction. Mistakes happen when news is breaking fast, but you need to own up to them. You'd think something like this would be blowing up on Reddit, but the ZeroHedge article here and the other thread with the Streamable video are pretty much only being discussed here. Its been posted a few other places, but most are obscure subs and the posts have zero comments. The shills have taken over this god forsaken site. It’s not okay to just fabricate occurrences? It seems to happen more and more often that the mainstream media gets caught faking stuff like this.

Now my question is, how often are they **not** caught red handed? How often are we all falling for made-up stories like this, since nobody recognized the old video by coincidence?

And more importantly, who is behind these hoaxes? Surely it‘s not just one journalist who is in on this.

How gives the orders to fabricate propaganda like that and fill Western media with it? Two things. One, apparently American recreation has more firepower than the Turkish military. /s Two, I can't help but feel that the video doesn't even match the description the newscaster is reading. There's no structures or anything, and it's basically a narrow flat area between two tree-ridged berms. Just a lot of ordnance going off into the distance. Copied from another thread:

Two things make this especially bad. They didn't just show this footage in the background, they explicitly claimed it was footage of Turkey 'bombing Kurdish civilians'. Implicitly claiming they had not only verified the footage, but somehow knew it was civilians being shot at, not a battle with PKK fighters. And whats especially egregious is that in the original footage, there's a huge crowd of onlookers. Someone had to deceptively crop out the giant crowd of people watching and recording with their cell phones just to create the fake footage. So it was an intentional fake.

All of this propaganda is being fed to Americans to convince them that shit like this is normal and acceptable. How do you get a population to accept that a child should be put on hormone blockers and rendered infertile for life due to childish ideas of switching genders?

It's shockingly easy: Show us a group of people that we assume are real people like us, and have them cheer and applaud and encourage this behavior. The people at home are left to assume *they're* the crazy ones for initially disagreeing with this insanity portrayed as reality.

If you find yourself saying: *""Oh that's too extreme, kids shouldn't be put on puberty blockers.""* But then follow it up with: *""Wait till they're adults to make that decision""* You've successfully had your values shifted; 
You're now *accepting* sex reassignment of the mentally ill as being correct rather than demanding they be treated for a mental disorder. A grown mentally ill person is no more capable of making such a decision than a 10 year old. Don't let them shift your values simply by walking back from an even more absurd extreme.

Remember: The inhumanity of lobotomies was known to the medical community for decades, only when the public became cognizant of the outcomes and started protesting and demanding change did they stop the practice.  
Doctors know gender reassignment surgery is damaging nonsense, but they'll keep taking the paycheck as long as we're going to allow it.


**TLDR:** They packed the audience with people who would clap and cheer for a girl who has been brainwashed into acting like a boy in order to convince the American public that this is normal. I normally don’t care what Ben Shapiro has to say, but he was on fire about this, turned me into a fan.

I don't think his skinny ass would do too well in a state of anarchy. This turd had no business propagating his BS agenda in a classroom. “Higher education” needs to purge itself of activist professors. Ha I remember that giraffe necked idiot getting owned on a cable news show. 

His edge is diamond like. Soyboy I wasn't sure if I would ever see a leftist taken down for their tweets.  Hope? His pronouns he identifies with: douche/douchebag. This guy could curdle soy milk just by looking at it Someone please post this on r/news. I wanna see them get butt hurt. Wow, he *really* stuck his neck out there with some of those tweets. giraffe neck put his venmo in his twitter bio. pathetic. I'm going to possibly get a PhD, so I might wind up in academia. These people give academics such a bad name. If only this guy could see what society would be like without cops to protect him. Why do activists look like douche canoes? Imagine spending thousands of dollars, and multiple years going somewhere to learn how to do this for a living only to end up fired for your big mouth. Honestly, this feels like the school would have kept him on too if it wasn’t for the public uproar. This guy was consistently calling for the death of cops and nobody said a thing. My daughters wrist is thicker than his neck. How does he even hold his head up? Back in 2004, I had a community college ""Intro to Philosophy"" professor segue from Aristotle to how we could use astrological maps to prove that George W. Bush was the antichrist.

Completely straight faced. And then proceeded to play us a VHS tape of C-SPAN where they were having budget debates. Only passed the class with sheer luck. Forget that his beliefs are absolutely abhorrent to most people here - just pretend it's something else.  How could he expect *anyone* to take him seriously when he chooses to work for the very people he claims to hate?  Forget selling out - this guy ""pre-ordered."" These idiots.  

He says so much for free speech.  You idiotic child.  Free speech isn't absolute, and any institution can strip you of that right while you are being paid by them.

I shouldn't be surprised that somebody like that is teaching, though it goes a long way to explain why our kids are so dumb today. Universities are the breeding places for this kind of idiotic rhetoric anyway. No surprise here. The most surprising thing is that he actually faced discipline. He also looks like a fucking mook. 

Don’t worry though, you won’t have to teach future cops because you won’t be teaching anyone at all. I’m sure McDonald’s is hiring Man, his dad, Jeffrey is gonna be pissed. Took long enough. When are they going label this group as what it is....a domestic terrorist organization. My sister could beat him in a fight - he knows he's a weakling, that's why he trash talks from the safety of his boyfriend's bedroom. Why did it take this long is the real problem here. The first boss on Medieval Executioner Simulator 2020. That certainly is one long giraffe neck he has there. It's so long that when he drinks milk it curdles and turns to yoghurt on the way down. That's the antifa-supporting professor who was on Tucker's show a few months ago. I'd recognize that neck anywhere. > What's even the point of a cop that isn't dead?

This one just comes across as just plain stupid. It's not even saying anything, it just sounds like a wannabe edgy eight year old. I bet he tweeted it when he got angry reading the news in his mom's basement. He looks exactly like what I picture in my head when attributing that quote to someone. Going to get showered with downvotes for this but,

What he said was stupid and reprehensible, but should we be celebrating free speech being violated by an employer? Need I remind all of you of the public-facing liberal minded companies out there.

What if you made a conservative statement on the job and got canned for it? Professor???? He looks like he should be slinging java at a Starbucks or washing poodles > Internet detectives have since revealed that Isaacson has a fetish website profile.  That’s where he describes himself as “polyamorous” and “pansexual” and claims to be turned on by waterboarding, choking, smothering, anal sex, group sex, bondage, and other disgusting and depraved sex fetishes.

Ah so he's turned on by violence and degradation. That explains a lot. He's a psycho. Yet twitter allows his tweets.  JFC. Damn. Not even NWA was as visceral as this sad sack of garbage. fReEdOm Of SpEeCh DoSeN't MeAn FrEeDoM fRoM cOnSeQuEnCes. This guy is every guillotine's wet dream! That pic on the left lmfao Not far enough. How about we shoot him and feed him to the ocean instead? Finally. I have been following pencil neck for a while. This was long over due. The scary thing about this is there are so many more just like him out there teaching our kids. Lol get rekt Just a friendly reminder that Tucker Carlson decimated this ""professor"" on the national stage:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIKEHCXfjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIKEHCXfjU) Deepthroat Isn't that the same guy who Tucker Carlson had on his show and laughed at, like, a year or 2 ago, for defending antifa? Was the the dude that kicked a ladies phone out of her hand because she was pro life? Kinda looks like him. What he said is terrifying considering this is what college campuses and modern academia are turning into, what’s even scarier is that we have a professor at an “advanced” education institution that is an activist for a terrorist organization, unfairly subjecting impressionable young adults to his doctrine and diatribe that literally calls for the murder of a specific group of people. Kids and their parents are paying HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars/going HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars into debt to attend these schools... this is what they’re getting. He’s an “anti fascist”, yea? I don’t think he’s ever known what that actually means. Good. Fuck that giraffe-necked pile of soy. If he were in a Saw movie his puzzle would be to open a normal pickle jar on his own strength. How can you be so self righteous , self deprecating and be completely full of yourself at the same time? His neck looks abnormally long.... [deleted] Looks like a soyboy hipster. Good ridence. Oh sweet! So, this guy's belongings are up for grabs then, right? I mean surely he wouldn't call the cops to report it. Dude the neck on this guy Jesus Well he certainly looks the part of an antifa activist. Little delayed I think, but for now let's enjoy the schadenfreude. Fuck antfia. I hope it burns to the ground. So long, Stretch! Took them long enough to do it. John Jay is a liberal arts college.

Dat niggas neck tho Better luck necks time I thought this guy got fired right after the interview hit? Or was he just suspended? Highly unstable and emotional people tend not to make the best researchers or professors who need to put their biases aside for objectivity. Sounds like some red flag laws need to be used on this guy. 

Ain't that, right, Liberals?

You like government intervention and red flag laws. DADDYLONGNECKS GOT FIRED?   AHAHAHAHA! I remember when this piece of excrement was on Tucker years ago. Glad he's out. Now he can dedicate all his free to time riots and protesting. And nothing of value was lost. Just looking at him you can tell he's an antifa activist Necc Was he a professor in gender studies? He looks like a vegan milkshake brought to life. This guy was on Carlson a while back. It might be a little contreray, but while I find his views personally offensive, I think people ought to blhabe the freedom to express controversial ideas on public, personal social networks. I didn’t look into it, but if his—or anyone’s—account is linked to the university—or any entity of employment—fuck ‘em. But, it’s a little too thought-police-y for me to think someone with bad ideas should be punished for having them. Keep your fence posts away from this man. I seen this nigga. Good riddance. Hopefully he stays unemployed. Wasn’t this guy also found on some gay bondage fetish websites wanting to be tied up and shoved into a suitcase or some weird shit? Is that the guy in the picture?? He looks like a loser.. Anyway, I can't understand why anyone supports antifa. No, wait.. I was banned from r/Progressive  yesterday. I understand why they support antifa.. S0Y bOy gets fired. Now how is he going to pay for his soy??? No cop should have to be “taught” by such a joke. Finally I reach to the comment section. That's a long neck ride This is more than two years old. NECK Like most leftists, this guy looks like a date rapist pansy Well, I mean, even if they are the best at their job they will still die since we all will unless the rapture takes us first.

/s Hell yeah long neck finally got what he had coming Lol @ LaW eNfORcEmeNT tOdAy

Publishes story yesterday that in fact happened almost 2 years ago. 

Also, this guy is a fucking goof but let's not pretend cops are heroes. They are a big part of the American incarceration problem and always side with corporations over people. 

""Yo Dre, I got something to say ...""","Professor, Antifa activist who said ""it's a privilege to teach future dead cops"" gets fired""He also advocated for the death of cops and for anarchy in America.""

I don't think his skinny ass would do too well in a state of anarchy. This turd had no business propagating his BS agenda in a classroom. “Higher education” needs to purge itself of activist professors. Ha I remember that giraffe necked idiot getting owned on a cable news show. 

His edge is diamond like. Soyboy I wasn't sure if I would ever see a leftist taken down for their tweets.  Hope? His pronouns he identifies with: douche/douchebag. This guy could curdle soy milk just by looking at it Someone please post this on r/news. I wanna see them get butt hurt. Wow, he *really* stuck his neck out there with some of those tweets. giraffe neck put his venmo in his twitter bio. pathetic. I'm going to possibly get a PhD, so I might wind up in academia. These people give academics such a bad name. If only this guy could see what society would be like without cops to protect him. Why do activists look like douche canoes? Imagine spending thousands of dollars, and multiple years going somewhere to learn how to do this for a living only to end up fired for your big mouth. Honestly, this feels like the school would have kept him on too if it wasn’t for the public uproar. This guy was consistently calling for the death of cops and nobody said a thing. My daughters wrist is thicker than his neck. How does he even hold his head up? Back in 2004, I had a community college ""Intro to Philosophy"" professor segue from Aristotle to how we could use astrological maps to prove that George W. Bush was the antichrist.

Completely straight faced. And then proceeded to play us a VHS tape of C-SPAN where they were having budget debates. Only passed the class with sheer luck. Forget that his beliefs are absolutely abhorrent to most people here - just pretend it's something else.  How could he expect *anyone* to take him seriously when he chooses to work for the very people he claims to hate?  Forget selling out - this guy ""pre-ordered."" These idiots.  

He says so much for free speech.  You idiotic child.  Free speech isn't absolute, and any institution can strip you of that right while you are being paid by them.

I shouldn't be surprised that somebody like that is teaching, though it goes a long way to explain why our kids are so dumb today. Universities are the breeding places for this kind of idiotic rhetoric anyway. No surprise here. The most surprising thing is that he actually faced discipline. He also looks like a fucking mook. 

Don’t worry though, you won’t have to teach future cops because you won’t be teaching anyone at all. I’m sure McDonald’s is hiring Man, his dad, Jeffrey is gonna be pissed. Took long enough. When are they going label this group as what it is....a domestic terrorist organization. My sister could beat him in a fight - he knows he's a weakling, that's why he trash talks from the safety of his boyfriend's bedroom. Why did it take this long is the real problem here. The first boss on Medieval Executioner Simulator 2020. That certainly is one long giraffe neck he has there. It's so long that when he drinks milk it curdles and turns to yoghurt on the way down. That's the antifa-supporting professor who was on Tucker's show a few months ago. I'd recognize that neck anywhere. > What's even the point of a cop that isn't dead?

This one just comes across as just plain stupid. It's not even saying anything, it just sounds like a wannabe edgy eight year old. I bet he tweeted it when he got angry reading the news in his mom's basement. He looks exactly like what I picture in my head when attributing that quote to someone. Going to get showered with downvotes for this but,

What he said was stupid and reprehensible, but should we be celebrating free speech being violated by an employer? Need I remind all of you of the public-facing liberal minded companies out there.

What if you made a conservative statement on the job and got canned for it? Professor???? He looks like he should be slinging java at a Starbucks or washing poodles > Internet detectives have since revealed that Isaacson has a fetish website profile.  That’s where he describes himself as “polyamorous” and “pansexual” and claims to be turned on by waterboarding, choking, smothering, anal sex, group sex, bondage, and other disgusting and depraved sex fetishes.

Ah so he's turned on by violence and degradation. That explains a lot. He's a psycho. Yet twitter allows his tweets.  JFC. Damn. Not even NWA was as visceral as this sad sack of garbage. fReEdOm Of SpEeCh DoSeN't MeAn FrEeDoM fRoM cOnSeQuEnCes. This guy is every guillotine's wet dream! That pic on the left lmfao Not far enough. How about we shoot him and feed him to the ocean instead? Finally. I have been following pencil neck for a while. This was long over due. The scary thing about this is there are so many more just like him out there teaching our kids. Lol get rekt Just a friendly reminder that Tucker Carlson decimated this ""professor"" on the national stage:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIKEHCXfjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIKEHCXfjU) Deepthroat Isn't that the same guy who Tucker Carlson had on his show and laughed at, like, a year or 2 ago, for defending antifa? Was the the dude that kicked a ladies phone out of her hand because she was pro life? Kinda looks like him. What he said is terrifying considering this is what college campuses and modern academia are turning into, what’s even scarier is that we have a professor at an “advanced” education institution that is an activist for a terrorist organization, unfairly subjecting impressionable young adults to his doctrine and diatribe that literally calls for the murder of a specific group of people. Kids and their parents are paying HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars/going HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars into debt to attend these schools... this is what they’re getting. He’s an “anti fascist”, yea? I don’t think he’s ever known what that actually means. Good. Fuck that giraffe-necked pile of soy. If he were in a Saw movie his puzzle would be to open a normal pickle jar on his own strength. How can you be so self righteous , self deprecating and be completely full of yourself at the same time? His neck looks abnormally long.... [deleted] Looks like a soyboy hipster. Good ridence. Oh sweet! So, this guy's belongings are up for grabs then, right? I mean surely he wouldn't call the cops to report it. Dude the neck on this guy Jesus Well he certainly looks the part of an antifa activist. Little delayed I think, but for now let's enjoy the schadenfreude. Fuck antfia. I hope it burns to the ground. So long, Stretch! Took them long enough to do it. John Jay is a liberal arts college.   What do you expect?

Dat niggas neck tho Better luck necks time I thought this guy got fired right after the interview hit? Or was he just suspended? Highly unstable and emotional people tend not to make the best researchers or professors who need to put their biases aside for objectivity. Sounds like some red flag laws need to be used on this guy. 

Ain't that, right, Liberals?

You like government intervention and red flag laws. DADDYLONGNECKS GOT FIRED?   AHAHAHAHA! I remember when this piece of excrement was on Tucker years ago. Glad he's out. Now he can dedicate all his free to time riots and protesting. And nothing of value was lost. Just looking at him you can tell he's an antifa activist Necc Was he a professor in gender studies? He looks like a vegan milkshake brought to life. This guy was on Carlson a while back. It might be a little contreray, but while I find his views personally offensive, I think people ought to blhabe the freedom to express controversial ideas on public, personal social networks. I didn’t look into it, but if his—or anyone’s—account is linked to the university—or any entity of employment—fuck ‘em. But, it’s a little too thought-police-y for me to think someone with bad ideas should be punished for having them. Keep your fence posts away from this man. I seen this nigga. Good riddance. Hopefully he stays unemployed. Wasn’t this guy also found on some gay bondage fetish websites wanting to be tied up and shoved into a suitcase or some weird shit? Is that the guy in the picture?? He looks like a loser.. Anyway, I can't understand why anyone supports antifa. No, wait.. I was banned from r/Progressive  yesterday. I understand why they support antifa.. S0Y bOy gets fired.

914,WSJ Editorial Board: Make Dishwashers That Clean Again,Conservative,ChunkyArsenio,t5_2qh6p,dhpgt9,">  **Article:**

The political campaign to use less fossil-fuel energy has real-world consequences, and one is that modern appliances don’t work like they used to. The Trump Energy Department wants to let manufacturers make better dishwashers, and consumers are welcoming the idea. Manufacturers, not so much.

The dirty little nonsecret for years has been that modern dishwashers don’t clean dishes well. The culprit is federal efficiency standards, which have been tightened to use less energy. Dishwashers that once took an hour from wash to dry now average two hours and 20 minutes, and even then they don’t always do the job. A GE survey of 11,000 dishwasher owners reports that having to wait for hours for dishes to be done is a major consumer annoyance.

In March 2018 the folks at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, began a petition drive to do something about it. The Energy Department published the petition in the Federal Register with a request for comments.

“When DOE published the CEI petition last year, we received an overwhelmingly positive response from consumers who are tired of waiting for their dishes to dry or pre-washing their dishes by hand,” says Daniel Simmons, assistant secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The reaction was so positive that Energy wrote a draft rule to allow a new class of dishwashers featuring a cycle time of an hour or less.

Judging from the more than 2,700 comments already received, a great many Americans are not happy with what’s happened to their dishwashers. “I had no idea that energy regulations were affecting my dishwasher. Now that I know I am absolutely furious” says one. Another writes that “when you have to re wash your dishes because they stink does not save water.” Still another pleads: “For the love of all that is holy, help us make dishwashers work right again.”

Opponents say many of today’s dishwashers include an option for a one-hour cycle. Others cite the impact on the environment if dishwashers are allowed to use more energy and water. Some note that the industry itself opposes the new rule.

But the existing one-hour cycle works only with dishes that are lightly soiled. And for all the worries about environmental impact, there’s no consideration for the double washing that goes on because dishwashers are so lousy. As for industry objections, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers argues that dishwasher manufacturers have made significant investments to meet the current standards—and that relaxing these standards would make these stranded investments.

The proposed new rule would not force anyone to change current dishwasher models. If the machines are as good as the industry and environmentalists claim, consumers will stick with them. If not, why not give the American people the chance to buy dishwashers that actually clean dishes? The public comment period on the draft rule remains open until October 16. Then do showerheads! :P","WSJ Editorial Board: Make Dishwashers That Clean Again>  **Article:**

915,Bobby Jindal: Trump Wins Every Democratic Debate,Conservative,ChunkyArsenio,t5_2qh6p,dhpfud,">  **Article:**

The Republican National Committee should offer to be the official sponsor of a weekly Democratic presidential debate. There would be no better advertisement for President Trump’s re-election. Every time the Democratic presidential contenders gather together, it’s a contest between the merely delusional, the vaguely vindictive and the patently absurd.

There are funny moments, like when Andrew Yang risked the ire of the political-correctness police and told us, “I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors.” There are substantive moments, like when former Vice President Joe Biden reversed himself on China, apparently now agreeing with Mr. Trump that intellectual-property theft is a serious problem. The debates would make for entertaining television, were the ideas discussed not so dangerous.

John F. Kennedy challenged and inspired the nation by exhorting: “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” Today’s Democrats seem to believe JFK got it backward. They compete to see who can borrow and spend more money to give away more “free” government benefits. Mr. Yang brilliantly cuts out the middleman and, channeling his inner game-show host, showers cash on lucky supporters.

Jeb Bush famously remarked that he might have to “lose the primary to win the general.” Today’s Democrats have reversed that proposition—they seem intent on losing the general election to win the primary. Their radical ideas include open borders, confiscating guns, paying reparations for slavery, adding trillions of dollars in new government spending, taking away employer-based health care and restructuring the entire economy through the Green New Deal.

When it comes to health-care policy, some of the Democratic candidates are lying and some are merely confused, but all are deceiving the American people. President Obama falsely promised that Americans could keep their health care plans if they liked them. Today’s Democrats disagree on whether to kill private insurance quickly through Medicare for All or gradually through a government-run public option. They may differ on candor and strategic timing, but they all seem to want to take away consumers’ ability to choose and keep private health insurance.

Aside from Sen. Bernie Sanders, who at least is honest about how disruptive his plans would be, Democrats won’t tell doctors, hospitals and other providers that Medicare for All will cut their reimbursement rates by at least 11% on average, according to the socialists themselves, and by as much as 40% compared with private insurance rates. Democrats won’t tell taxpayers about the $33 trillion in new government spending projected over 10 years, or the only way to pay for it, which is higher taxes on the middle class.

Mr. Biden is trying to position himself as the moderate alternative to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders while avoiding the gaffes and unforced errors for which he’s known. This campaign strategy is like a football team playing prevent defense in the first quarter. It’s never a good sign when campaign staffers admit their plan is to hide the candidate from the voters. Upon closer inspection, however, Mr. Biden isn’t the moderate he claims to be. Judging by the policies he now supports, the Joe Biden of 2019 is much more liberal than Hillary Clinton or any other previous Democratic nominee.

Mr. Biden recently remarked that “nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.” That’s excellent news for Paul Manafort and Bernie Madoff. The former vice president now opposes the death penalty and wants to reverse key parts of his own 1994 crime bill. Like the other leading Democratic contenders, Mr. Biden wants taxpayer dollars to subsidize abortion. He wants to spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years to zero out America’s carbon emissions by 2050 and create a public option open to all, not just those on the ObamaCare exchanges. With more than a year to go before the election, there’s plenty of time for Mr. Biden to come out in favor of abolishing the Electoral College or packing the Supreme Court.

When 60% of Democrats want a nominee even more progressive than President Obama, it’s fair to say that these are dangerous times. Only Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders could make the Obama years seem like the good old days. Mr. Trump recently said, “Whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me,” implying that otherwise the left-wing radicals will destroy the country.

Many voters will be happy to vote for Mr. Trump because they approve of what he’s accomplished—cutting taxes, deregulating the economy, unleashing domestic energy production, investing in the military, appointing conservative judges and supporting Israel. There will, however, be voters who are not particularly fond of him but will choose him over the Democrats. Far better to bear four more years of Mr. Trump’s mercurial temperament, these voters will rightly conclude, than risk it all on the Democrats’ radical and destructive policies.

*Mr. Jindal served as governor of Louisiana, 2008-16, and was a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.* Truer words have never been spoken. Trump is going to going to be the recipient of many ""protest votes"" by reluctant people who have to acknowledge that this presidency, though not without it's rough moments, was not nearly as bad as was promised.","Bobby Jindal: Trump Wins Every Democratic Debate>  **Article:**

This campaign strategy is like a football team playing prevent defense in the first quarter. It’s never a good sign when campaign staffers admit their plan is to hide the candidate from the voters. Upon closer inspection, however, Mr. Biden isn’t the moderate he claims to be. Judging by the policies he now supports, the Joe Biden of 2019 is much more liberal than Hillary Clinton or any other previous Democratic nominee.

Mr. Biden recently remarked that “nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.” That’s excellent news for Paul Manafort and Bernie Madoff. The former vice president now opposes the death penalty and wants to reverse key parts of his own 1994 crime bill. Like the other leading Democratic contenders, Mr. Biden wants taxpayer dollars to subsidize abortion. He wants to spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years to zero out America’s carbon emissions by 2050 and create a public option open to all, not just those on the ObamaCare exchanges. With more than a year to go before the election, there’s plenty of time for Mr. Biden to come out in favor of abolishing the Electoral College or packing the Supreme Court.

When 60% of Democrats want a nominee even more progressive than President Obama, it’s fair to say that these are dangerous times. Only Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders could make the Obama years seem like the good old days. Mr. Trump recently said, “Whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me,” implying that otherwise the left-wing radicals will destroy the country.

Many voters will be happy to vote for Mr. Trump because they approve of what he’s accomplished—cutting taxes, deregulating the economy, unleashing domestic energy production, investing in the military, appointing conservative judges and supporting Israel. There will, however, be voters who are not particularly fond of him but will choose him over the Democrats. Far better to bear four more years of Mr. Trump’s mercurial temperament, these voters will rightly conclude, than risk it all on the Democrats’ radical and destructive policies.

*Mr. Jindal served as governor of Louisiana, 2008-16, and was a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.* Truer words have never been spoken. Trump is going to going to be the recipient of many ""protest votes"" by reluctant people who have to acknowledge that this presidency, though not without it's rough moments, was not nearly as bad as was promised."

941,Why do liberals in America live such a sad life of continual outrage,Conservative,optionhome,t5_2qh6p,dho8pa,"Plenty of reasons. Everyone has an fundamental drive to set and work towards goals. You actually receive happiness by making accomplishments on the path to your goal, not so much after actually achieving them. Problem is, the participation trophy generation (my generation) doesn't like to work towards anything. People also like to think they are virtuous. For this reason, they manufacture issues that only virtuous people can solve, and fight to make them happen. Now, because they are manufactured they can't make any actual progress on them, which means they get no happiness from this pursuit. They don't know how to comprehend it, so they say the problem runs deeper than they had initially thought. Nevermind fighting these problems where they actually occur, such as the middle east or china, that would be too difficult. They'd rather pretend they are doing something from the safety of their computer.

Second, they all think they're victims. Because of this switch in ideology, they are rewarded amongst themselves for being victims. This means that they have incentivized to be outraged. I’ve come to realize that most people who play identity politics are extremely unhappy in their day-to-day lives. How in the hell could you wake up and enjoy your day thinking everything is a micro aggression/that you’re being oppressed by everyone around you? How could you lead a fulfilling life while morbidly obese and being told that eating yourself to death and acceptable and even “attractive”? 

The left wants to take away high standards of living and allow people to live in their bad habits and offended state of mind. It’s impossible to be happy when you’re literally promoting an unhappy lifestyle. Liberalism and Conservatism are essentially glass half empty and glass half full worldviews.  While Conservatives celebrate what we do well and work on fixing what needs to be improved, Liberals wallow in what we don't get right while ignoring all of our advances and successes.  

Liberalism is an ideology of perceived victimhood and oppression and requires people being treated unfairly to exist.  It thrives on projected victimhood, and why the slippery slope arguments are so accurate when applied to Progressives -- its a belief system about the unending need to push forward, so there's never the opportunity to celebrate everything they've won because there's even more oppressed people we need to focus on now.  Its how the gay marriage fight turned into the Transgenderism fight and we're even seeing groundwork laid for their future defense of pedophilia.  

When your ideology is based on perpetual unfairness, it will turn you into a bitter, cynical person.  Studies show that Conservatives are happier overall than Liberals.  Of course, because we celebrate everything great about American culture while Liberals bemoan how much further we have yet to go. Liberals want everyone to be as miserable as they are.  That is the only end game to their actions, whether they know it or not. So far I agree with all these reasons.  Definitely the glorification and sanctification of victimhood.  

One idea that I don't see having been explored yet is the lack of an underlying faith in a higher power, other than their own warped sense of conscience.  I'm not overly religious myself, but the left goes about its way with the same zeal as some of the most die hard religious people.  

Consider the following:

* If you don't believe in leftist/liberal dogma, its not that you have a differing opinion on the solution to a problem.  It's that you are evil, stupid, or ignorant.
* They beatify individuals based on their ability to bring and spread the message.  Pictures of Barack Obama with a byzantine style halo, Greta Thunberg being called the ""Successor of Jesus"" by the Church of Sweden.
* If you turn away from the dogma of the left you are branded a heretic and treated as such.  See: James Woods, Milton Friedman, Jordan Peterson and just about every black conservative with any type of following.
* They have sacred texts such as the IPCC report on climate change, Alinksi's rules for radicals, Mao's little red book.  
* There are also the shibboleths such as ""pay their fair share"",  ""common sense gun laws"", ""for the children"", and ""do something"".

The first problem with this new religion of the left is that it is constantly being built as it goes along.  When it finds another aspect of your life that needs to be controlled, they just add a new chapter to their dogma.  The second problem is that unlike most religions there's no component of forgiveness or acceptance of some transgressions.  Its literally like the Old Testament or some of the Quran's more violent surahs and if you cannot forgive or accept an outcome you cannot really move past that and focus on the positive aspects of your life.

Ultimately this pseudo religion that the left has built around itself has the desire to control every aspect of the lives of the people around them, but neither the true will or means to do so.  Some of the smarter ones know that if they continue the long march they've been on through both the institutions and culture they'll get there, but the latest rounds of their political foot soldiers have taken upon themselves heat up the proverbial water too fast and the frog is trying to jump out of the pot.

I fear that we're quite close to a Mohammed on the way to Mecca moment when dealing with them, if it hasn't started already.  See Antifa's antics. Life is a comedy to those who think and a tragedy to those who feel.

I don’t know who coined that phrase but it sums it up pretty well.  I don’t know any leftists that are real critical thinkers. Jonathan Haidt -- read his book ... or find videos where he describes how we got here. Simply: because social media determined outrage is the most successful exposure tool. They prioritize outrage content to push ad revenue. They keep everyone outraged to farm cash. There was a great senate(?) heading on the matter. I’ll see if I can find it. It’s fascinating. One big problem is that large percentage of liberals are professional or amateur activists. You know like there are professional revolutionaries who have fat bank accounts without working an honest job a day in their life (think Arafat). Same with these guys.  They are incapable of doing anything productive, so they need a crisis to fight. If they can't find a crisis to fight, they create one. From gun violence ""epidemic,"" to income inequality, to racism, to global warming, they just create BS problems so that they could get money and fame fighting them. I just refer to them as the “Perpetually aggrieved” They've been demoralized and programmed. 


https://youtu.be/QfvXwuZ-bok It's 100% about the education system in America.

They've been told since the day they entered kindergarten that they can be whatever they want to be - or at least, they *could've been,* if those greedy bigoted privileged bastards weren't holding them down. Without a solid foundation in the home (which the left is of course trying its damnedest to erode), the only message kids are getting is that the white cishet male cabal is using capitalism to keep everyone else under their thumb, and that the outdated Constitution and all its negative rights is letting them do it. Can someone make a Canada one for me. It’s true. They suffer regardless of the administration. I just spent a week in Seattle and another in Alabama. Everyone in Seattle is gloom and doom. Not a word of politics in Alabama - real good people there! It’s funny I always felt this away about conservatives... There's a lot of reasons for this. But there's only one that I know most will agree on. 

When I'm offended by something you did or said, you now owe me something in compensation. Once you have aggrieved me in some manner I now hold some form of power over you. They're addicted to stress. They are never satisfied by definition. Satisfaction for them means they need to worry, they need to find something to worry about; they have to stir the pot for a fix. cause Liberalism is a disease [removed] Because their God [Obama] is gone. [removed] While I know you are having some fun memeing, I'd like to know what made up issues you have in mind here.

My top concerns as an American include things that allow us all the achieve life, liberty, and happiness.  Income inequality (currently at the highest level ever), access to affordable healthcare, access to high quality education for our children and young adults, and safety from threats abroad as well as internal.  Are these really divisive issues?  

Yes I might have a different stance on same sex marriage, legalization of certain drugs, or *sigh* even bathroom politics but come on, those are NOT the main challenges facing our country and the vast majority of even the most liberal left acknowledge that.  Those are tertiary issues, they just get so much attention because of how far apart our viewpoints might be.

For this reason, they manufacture issues that only virtuous people can solve, and fight to make them happen. Now, because they are manufactured they can't make any actual progress on them, which means they get no happiness from this pursuit. They don't know how to comprehend it, so they say the problem runs deeper than they had initially thought. Nevermind fighting these problems where they actually occur, such as the middle east or china, that would be too difficult. They'd rather pretend they are doing something from the safety of their computer.

Second, they all think they're victims. Because of this switch in ideology, they are rewarded amongst themselves for being victims. This means that they have incentivized to be outraged. I’ve come to realize that most people who play identity politics are extremely unhappy in their day-to-day lives. How in the hell could you wake up and enjoy your day thinking everything is a micro aggression/that you’re being oppressed by everyone around you? How could you lead a fulfilling life while morbidly obese and being told that eating yourself to death and acceptable and even “attractive”? 

The left wants to take away high standards of living and allow people to live in their bad habits and offended state of mind. It’s impossible to be happy when you’re literally promoting an unhappy lifestyle. Liberalism and Conservatism are essentially glass half empty and glass half full worldviews.  While Conservatives celebrate what we do well and work on fixing what needs to be improved, Liberals wallow in what we don't get right while ignoring all of our advances and successes.  

Liberalism is an ideology of perceived victimhood and oppression and requires people being treated unfairly to exist.  It thrives on projected victimhood, and why the slippery slope arguments are so accurate when applied to Progressives -- its a belief system about the unending need to push forward, so there's never the opportunity to celebrate everything they've won because there's even more oppressed people we need to focus on now.  Its how the gay marriage fight turned into the Transgenderism fight and we're even seeing groundwork laid for their future defense of pedophilia.  

When your ideology is based on perpetual unfairness, it will turn you into a bitter, cynical person.  Studies show that Conservatives are happier overall than Liberals.  Of course, because we celebrate everything great about American culture while Liberals bemoan how much further we have yet to go. Liberals want everyone to be as miserable as they are.  That is the only end game to their actions, whether they know it or not. So far I agree with all these reasons.  Definitely the glorification and sanctification of victimhood.  

One idea that I don't see having been explored yet is the lack of an underlying faith in a higher power, other than their own warped sense of conscience.  I'm not overly religious myself, but the left goes about its way with the same zeal as some of the most die hard religious people.  

Consider the following:

* If you don't believe in leftist/liberal dogma, its not that you have a differing opinion on the solution to a problem.  It's that you are evil, stupid, or ignorant.
* They beatify individuals based on their ability to bring and spread the message.  Pictures of Barack Obama with a byzantine style halo, Greta Thunberg being called the ""Successor of Jesus"" by the Church of Sweden.
* If you turn away from the dogma of the left you are branded a heretic and treated as such.  See: James Woods, Milton Friedman, Jordan Peterson and just about every black conservative with any type of following.
* They have sacred texts such as the IPCC report on climate change, Alinksi's rules for radicals, Mao's little red book.  
* There are also the shibboleths such as ""pay their fair share"",  ""common sense gun laws"", ""for the children"", and ""do something"".

The first problem with this new religion of the left is that it is constantly being built as it goes along.  When it finds another aspect of your life that needs to be controlled, they just add a new chapter to their dogma.  The second problem is that unlike most religions there's no component of forgiveness or acceptance of some transgressions.  Its literally like the Old Testament or some of the Quran's more violent surahs and if you cannot forgive or accept an outcome you cannot really move past that and focus on the positive aspects of your life.

Ultimately this pseudo religion that the left has built around itself has the desire to control every aspect of the lives of the people around them, but neither the true will or means to do so.  Some of the smarter ones know that if they continue the long march they've been on through both the institutions and culture they'll get there, but the latest rounds of their political foot soldiers have taken upon themselves heat up the proverbial water too fast and the frog is trying to jump out of the pot.

I fear that we're quite close to a Mohammed on the way to Mecca moment when dealing with them, if it hasn't started already.  See Antifa's antics. Life is a comedy to those who think and a tragedy to those who feel.

I don’t know who coined that phrase but it sums it up pretty well.  I don’t know any leftists that are real critical thinkers. Jonathan Haidt -- read his book ... or find videos where he describes how we got here. Simply: because social media determined outrage is the most successful exposure tool. They prioritize outrage content to push ad revenue. They keep everyone outraged to farm cash. There was a great senate(?) heading on the matter. I’ll see if I can find it. It’s fascinating. One big problem is that large percentage of liberals are professional or amateur activists. You know like there are professional revolutionaries who have fat bank accounts without working an honest job a day in their life (think Arafat). Same with these guys.  They are incapable of doing anything productive, so they need a crisis to fight. If they can't find a crisis to fight, they create one. From gun violence ""epidemic,"" to income inequality, to racism, to global warming, they just create BS problems so that they could get money and fame fighting them. I just refer to them as the “Perpetually aggrieved” They've been demoralized and programmed. 


https://youtu.be/QfvXwuZ-bok It's 100% about the education system in America.

They've been told since the day they entered kindergarten that they can be whatever they want to be - or at least, they *could've been,* if those greedy bigoted privileged bastards weren't holding them down. Without a solid foundation in the home (which the left is of course trying its damnedest to erode), the only message kids are getting is that the white cishet male cabal is using capitalism to keep everyone else under their thumb, and that the outdated Constitution and all its negative rights is letting them do it. Can someone make a Canada one for me. It’s true. They suffer regardless of the administration. I just spent a week in Seattle and another in Alabama. Everyone in Seattle is gloom and doom. Not a word of politics in Alabama - real good people there! It’s funny I always felt this away about conservatives... There's a lot of reasons for this. But there's only one that I know most will agree on. 

When I'm offended by something you did or said, you now owe me something in compensation. Once you have aggrieved me in some manner I now hold some form of power over you. They're addicted to stress. They are never satisfied by definition. Satisfaction for them means they need to worry, they need to find something to worry about; they have to stir the pot for a fix. cause Liberalism is a disease [removed] Because their God [Obama] is gone. [removed] While I know you are having some fun memeing, I'd like to know what made up issues you have in mind here.

My top concerns as an American include things that allow us all the achieve life, liberty, and happiness.  Income inequality (currently at the highest level ever), access to affordable healthcare, access to high quality education for our children and young adults, and safety from threats abroad as well as internal.  Are these really divisive issues?  

Yes I might have a different stance on same sex marriage, legalization of certain drugs, or *sigh* even bathroom politics but come on, those are NOT the main challenges facing our country and the vast majority of even the most liberal left acknowledge that.  Those are tertiary issues, they just get so much attention because of how far apart our viewpoints might be. [removed]"

High School if this garbage continues. Track and Field WILL become a complete joke. I'm perfectly happy people suffering through this now, because it is going to get a lot worse when the left finally gets the power it craves.

Until people start coming out and putting the blame where it belongs: insane leftists and Democrat ideology, then they deserve what they get. Here's the easy solution: Sex and gender mean the same thing, as they always have, and cannot be changed. Taking performance enhancing drugs, including hormones, bars someone from competition, as it always has. Problem solved. It's unfair and I feel like the majority of people agree with this stance! Allowing genetically stronger and faster athletes to compete against other genders and calling it “justice for trans” is like allowing criminals to rob one house per week and calling it “justice for the poor” Whats really fucked here, is that we don't actually separate our sports (in the US) by male and female. We have open sports, and female-only sports. There is no reason to place these mentally ill people in the female-only divisions when they can go in the open divisions just as easily. 

They're just doing this to bully women into accepting their ideology. Shapiro was discussing this with Neil T. on his last podcast. He half heartedly suggested using levels of testosterone to decide classes, but include both male and female. Weird discussion. What if sports went to body type vs gender. So in other words; the left is screwing over women in favor of men. We have biological male sports and biological female sports, why not a trans-gender sport leagues? And if they want to show inclusiveness, allow any gender to compete? Why....it's almost like....there's a *difference* or something..... The feminists are silent on this one. Waiting for a march against this... Considering there are so many out there who don’t believe there is any gender equality, I would think letting transathletes compete would be a step in the wrong direction. Biological men competing against women in a sport like track is completely unfair. Look let them do sports but just group them together so its fair and put a trans prefix before every sport that way no can complain and if someone wants to then i dont give a shit you cant blame me for trying those fucking special snowflakes Personally I have always disliked professional athletes. It's definitely not a healthy lifestyle and it shouldn't be promoted to young children.

Particularly the “peace dividend,” which saw us so unprepared that in 2000 we had the Cole, in 2001 we had a malicious sneak attack, and in 2011 we abandoned our people in Libya, where in the 1980s and 1990s the world feared the thought of an American Force approaching their airspace, their shores or their land, we have now tasted the bitter weeds of a long conflict and it must find in its origin the shameful reduction in appropriations in the 1990s and the price gouging of the 2000s and 2010s. 

We do have the greatest individuals in the world serving, we have the best equipment, but I certainly believe that we haven’t enough to do the job of serving the world. As inflation rises, as defense contractors make more in a year than they made for the duration of WW2, even adjusted for inflation, as our soldiers, sailors and airmen survive on barely adequate raises in pay, as our numbers are fewer, our units and bases deactivated, our carrier strength limited, I say no action by this President can do any greater harm than any of this. Someone has a stake in Halliburton What's wrong Pete? Cant find any Christians to insult so you start on veterans? Honour them by posting them on Southern border."

959,Digital Genocide: I May No Longer Be Able To Support President Trump And You Are Probably Next - The purpose of this article is to ask President Trump What the **** is he waiting for to stop the destruction of the 1st Amendment by Facebook?,Conservative,According_Routine,t5_2qh6p,dhl3pa,"Uh, he’s not a dictator. Facebook will only be stopped by a very creative and brilliant lawsuit, which somehow expands the enforcement of the first amendment to digital “public spaces on private property.” Social Media platforms really should get to decide what is allowed on their platform and what isn't.

The problems arise when people don't know what the rules are, where the line is.

If they want to suppress  ""hate speech,"" fine, it's their right. But they need to actually define, not let it be some nebulous term that covers whatever they deem it so on that day.

Like what YT did with Crowder recently, they stated he broke no rules, even going back several years. Still they came to the conclusion that he broke a rule and was subsequently demonetized.

Or the many people who get violation notices but never state what caused the violation.

If you want to reel these companies in, they must be made to clearly define the rules and enforce them evenly. You misunderstand the roles that our government powers play. The Executive branch does not create laws. That is the role of the Legislative Branch. I stopped using facebook years ago. They are a liberal and corrupt company and I am not sure why anyone who is a conservative would still be supporting their platform by using it. Honestly, social media including this website is a cancer and die They're just doing what their Chinese overlords tell them. If I remember a recent quote from Zuckerberg,  he reversed a position from being a social media platform to being a content provider.

This reversal puts Facebook in a different legal position. 

Knowing that Facebook is a publically traded company that has a far reaching ability to manipulate people's opinions, we need as individuals hold them accountable. How I am not sure, my way was to get off Facebook, 

There is a problem that a small group of people cal manipulate a large group but that is what the press (mass media) has been doing since the beginning. Read how the Hursts and other media barons have done in the past, to varying degrees of success.

Stay vigilant and question all media,  there are agendas being played out, especially at Facebook.","Digital Genocide: I May No Longer Be Able To Support President Trump And You Are Probably Next - The purpose of this article is to ask President Trump What the **** is he waiting for to stop the destruction of the 1st Amendment by Facebook?Uh, he’s not a dictator.

Putting some solar panels on your roof or using a windmill doesn't affect the infrastructure used to transfer that electricity which is the part that's in danger.

These aren't even relevant to the subject but since it was brought up let's check that shit out. Oh it turns out typhus isn't isolated to just  California, there was an outbreak in Texas last year.

Hard to believe, I know. Only in Clown World is a vile criminal scum now the victim >He's got some responsibility, but not all...

Logic: If he had not robbed a store and threatened the employees and customers with a firearm he would still be alive.

It's sad to see someone lose their life over something so petty as the few bucks he'd likely get from the store. He made that choice, though. You can't lay his decisions at someone else's feet. The dirty thief was just trying to make a living. It's not much but it's dishonest work... But wait... I thought it was ""fuck the poleece""? 

I'm confused.  “Yes, he’s robbing y’all. Oh well. Call the police. That’s what you’re supposed to do. You’re not supposed to take matters into your own hands,”

Really? Is the clerk suppose to go, ""please stop pointing the gun at me for a min, I am going to call the police now""?

Are these people deranged? If a robber points a gun at me, and if I have a gun, you bet I am going to defend myself. The law is clear on this point. And not only the point is clear, the morality is also clear. A violent criminal being shot dead in the middle of a crime .. is ""getting what he or she deserves"".

The clerk is the victim. I am sorry he has to deal with this. He did not ask to be robbed. He did not ask to be threatened. He almost lost his life. I am glad how this turned out. Love a story with a happy ending. Good the robber deserves what he got. How about: Oh, well, he shouldn’t have robbed him in the first place, call yourself an ambulance. I just watched the video of her dumb ass. She really is not helping her case. She sounds like a complete fucking idiot. ""Yeah he's robbing you, OH WELL, call the police.

Unreal. Their brother forfeited his right to live the moment he brandished his weapon and tried to rob the store. And nothing of value was lost. One less idiot to taint the genepool. At the end of the video, the sister began to make a violent threat against the clerk and the news cut that out.  I wonder why. I understand that you lost a family member, and that sucks. I cannot even imagine what that begins to feel like. But let's not act like what you're brother was doing was the lord's work. This wasn't Nipsy Hussle. Your brother was shot and killed robbing a dollar store. Once you pull a weapon in someone's face, it automatically becomes a life or death situation. Do you really expect the clerk to pick up the phone, and call the police with a gun in his face? Especially not knowing whether or not that robber is going to pull the trigger for calling the police! No, that man's instinct in the moment is defend himself anyway possible, and that's probably why he's never going to be charged with a murder. Has anyone seen this video on any of the major subs?  Curious if the consensus agrees with these people. Good riddance. So, if their brother had shot someone, even bye accident, would that have been bad or alright? Can we shoot the siblings... to the moon? Is that Jimmy Kimmel on the left? Nobody gonna point out that she was wearing a shirt that has the word ""HAPPY"" printed all over it?

He knew the consequences of robbing a store in the US. He still did it. Too bad so sad. >Yes, he's robbing them. Oh, well! Call the police.

>Police said that the Gettysburg store has been robbed four times this year.

Yes, they really did go ""Oh well"" and call the police, three times that year. It's usual policy to just let the store be robbed, because the insurance companies worked out that the risk of employees or customers getting hurt is worse than the money being stolen. That's a fine theory for when robberies are rare, no one can live with getting robbed regularly. What they really wanted is a cop to shoot the brother so they could try to sue the city on a bad shooting. Can't sue the city when a normal citizen dealt with it. Sometimes segregation makes sense. Should we be hard on the sisters or family of the robber? 

I'd say no. People say all sorts of things when a loved one dies, no matter the circumstances.

If you want to vilify those who agree with the sisters, by all means, they have no emotional attachment to the robber. They are just trying to victimize someone who felt the consequences of his actions.","The siblings of an ARMED robber who was shot and killed last week while robbing an Dollar store say it was ""wrong"" for the store clerk to defend himself by pulling a firearm and shooting the robber.
